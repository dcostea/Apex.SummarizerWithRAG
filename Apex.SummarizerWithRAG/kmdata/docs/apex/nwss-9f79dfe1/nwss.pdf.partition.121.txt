SIDEEDGE
A Bedsheet-Hammock may be quickly con-
verted into a comfortableSuspended Bedsheet-Chair
so that a shelter occupant can sit comfortably, yet
occupy less floor space during the daytime. Follow
these steps:
I. Select one end of the hammock to be the top of
the back of the chair.
2. From this end, measure 52 inches (4 ft 4 in.)
along each side-edge of the hammock (see
sketch), and mark these two spots.
3. About i z inches in from these two marks
(toward the centerline of the hammock), make
two more marks.
MAKING A SUSPENDED BEDSHEET-CHAIR
4. To make an attachment point for a chair "arm",
hold a pebble (or a lump of earth) under one of
these last marks, pull the double-thickness cloth
tight around the pebble, and tie it in place. (See
illustration.) Repeat on the otherside-edge of the
hammock.
5. Tie the end of one rope (or "rope" made of 10-
inch-wide strip of strong cloth) to one attach-
ment point, and the end of another rope to the
other attachment point.
6. Suspend the top of the back of the chair to a
suspension point on the ceiling atleast 4 inches
out from the wall, and adjust the length of this
suspending rope so that the chair arms will be
about the same height from the floor as the arms
of an easy chair (see sketch).
7. Suspend the arms of the chair from two
suspension points 20 inches apart and 20 inches
farther out from the wall than the suspension
point of the back of the chair. (Study the
illustration.)
8. Fold the unused end of the hammock up and
back into the "seat"of the chair; fill the hollow of
the seat with coats, a blanket, or anything else
soft, to make it comfortable.
9. Adjust the lengths of all three suspending ropes
so that the chair seat is the right height for the
person sitting in it. When both feet are flat on the
floor, the front edge of the seat should not press
against the undersides of the thighs.
10. To simplify repeated conversion of the hammock
to a chair, mark the spot on each of the 3Chapter 15
Improvised Clothing and Protective Items
BASIC PRINCIPLES OF
COLD WEATHER CLOTHING
If Americans would learn to use skillfully the
ordinary clothing, towels, cloth, newspapers, and
paper bags in their homes, they could keep warm
enough to stay healthy-even under much colder
conditions than they believe endurable without
specialized outdoor winter clothing. Efficient cold-
weather clothing can be improvised if the following
ways of conserving body heat are understood and
used:
• Trap"dead"air. Covering enough of your body
with a thick layer of trapped "dead" air is the basic
requirement for keeping warm. Figure 15.1 shows
how efficient body insulation 'works: Both the air
warmed by close contact with the skin and the water
vapor from evaporated perspiration flow outward
into the insulating material. Any material that breaks
up and separates air into spaces no more than 1/8 inch

across has efficient cells of "dead" air. Air that is
within 1/16 inch of any surface-whether that of a
filament of goose down or of a piece of paper-is
slowed down by "sticking" to that surface and
becoming hard to move.
