 with an ax
on the bottom, top,and inner sides. The three poles
were each 55 inches long. They were notched and
spiked together with 60-penny nails so that the door
would close snugly on its similarly constructed base
made of three stout poles. Other poles, at least 7
inches in diameter before being hewn so that they
would fit together snugly, were nailed side-by-sideon
top of the three outer poles.
Many Americans have axes and would beable to
cut poles, but not manyknow how to usean ax to hew
flat, squaresides on a pole or log. This easily acquired
skill is illustrated by Fig. D.17. The worker should
first fasten the pole down by nailing two small poles
to it and to other logs on the ground. Figure D.l7
shows a pole thus secured. When hewing a flat side,
the worker stands with his legs spread far apart, and
repeatedly moves his feet so that he can look almost
straight down at where his ax head strikes. First,
vertical cuts with a sharp ax are made about 3 or 4
inches apart and at angles of about 45° to the surface
of the pole, for the length ofthe pole. These multiple
cuts should be made almost as deep as is needed to
produce a flat side of the desired width. Then the
worker, again beginning at the starting end, should
cut off long strips, producing a flat side.,WIRE SAFETY LOOP
