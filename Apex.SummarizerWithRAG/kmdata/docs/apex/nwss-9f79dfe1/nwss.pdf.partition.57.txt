alFanning
is that almost anyone who is given the field-
tested instructions can quickly make and use
one of these simple fans. Only very widely
available materials are needed. The main dis-
advantage is thatDirectionalFanningis a more
laborious way to ventilate a shelter than using
KAPs, as described in detail in Appendix B.
Americans are not likely to receive Direc-
tional Fanning instructions from the Federal
Emergency ManagementAgency. FEMA'spre-
decessors, the Office of Civil Defense and the
Defense Civil Preparedness Agency, were un-
able to get the millions of dollars necessary to
buy factory-made KAPs and other manual air
pumps to ventilate officially.designated fallout
shelters, and FEMA has avoided shelter venti-
lating controversies. No widely available offi-
cialAmericanpublicationincludes instructions
for making and using any expedient air-
pumping device.
ThankstoCongressmanIkeSkelton,Demo-
crat of Missouri and strong civil defense
advocate, in 1981 I was able to demonstrate
Directional Fanning to Louis Giuffrida, at that
time the Director of FEMA. I gave Directional
Fans to the FEMA specialists concerned with
shelter ventilation, all of whom have since left
FEMA. To date, although Directional Fanning
instructions have been reproduced in three pri-
vate civil defense publications, and some 600
copies of a metric version of the instructions
were distributedto British civil defense profes-
sionalsatthe 1984AnnualStudyof CivilDefence
and Emergency Planning Officers, FEMA has
not even evaluated Directional Fanning.
In contrast, in 1981 I gave copies ofinstruc-
tions for both KAPs and Directional Fans to Dr.
Yin Zhi-shu, the Director of the People's Repu-
blic of China's National Research and Design
Institute of Civil Defense - and the next day he
started evaluating these simple devices. (At
that time I was traveling extensively in China
as an official guest, exchanging civil defense
information.) Dr. Yin, who heads all Chinese
civil defense research and development, went
with his top ventilation and shelter design
specialis.ts to a furniture factory in Beijing.
There I watched workmen quickly build both a
large and a small KAP, and also Directional
Fans. Then Dr. Yin and his specialists began
using their air-velocity meters to measure the
volumes of air that these simple devices could
pump. On the following days I participated in
more ventilation tests using KAPs and Direc-
tional Fans in tunnel blast shelters in Beijing
and in the port city of Dalien.
While watching these top Chinese civil
defense professionals make and test KAPs and
Directional Fans, I kept thinking: "This is the
way Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would
have evaluatedsimpledevicesof possible great
importance to millions."
The reader is urged to keep the following
two pages of Directional Fanning instructions
ready for reproduction in a crisis. The sections
on the small 2-handled Directional Fan and the
large 1-Man Fan will be the most useful to
unprepared people. Ventilation by pairs of men
using Bedsheet Fans is an effective method for
forcing very large volumes of outdoor air
through tunnels, corridors and mines with ceil-
ings at least 9 feet high - provided they have
two large openings. However, this method re-
quires organization and discipline.DIRECTIONAL FANNING TO VENTILATE SHELTERS
