you are building a pump using wire netting for
flap-stops (see Fig. 13), then do NOT cut a notch in
the center of each flap.]
c. Take the 9 pieces of straightened wire and
insert one of them into and through the hem-tunnel
of each flap, like a curtain rod running through the
hem of a curtain. Check to see that each flap
swings freely on its pivot-wire, as illustrated by Fig.
7. Also see Fig. 8.

Ifyou have tacks (NOTthumbtacks) or verysmall
nails, drive three in a horizontal line to attach each
flap-stop-one ineach ofthe two vertical 36-in.sides of
the frame and one in the vertical center brace (see
Fig. II). First, drive all of these horizontal lines of
tacks about three-quarters of the way into the
boards. Then, to secure the flap-stop string or thin
wire quickly to a tack, wind the string around the
tack and immediately drive the tack tightly into the
frame to grip the string (see Fig. II).
If you have no tacks or nails, cut notches or
slots where the flap-stops .are to be attached. Cut
these notches in the edges of the vertical sides of
the frame and in an edge of the center brace. Next,
secure the flap-stops (strings or wires) by tying each
4. The flap-stops
So that the flaps may swing open on only one
side of the frame (on its front, or face), you must
attach horizontal flap-stops made of strings or
wires across the face of the frame. (See Figs. 10and
II.) Nailor tie four of these flap-stops between the
marked points where each pair of the horizontal
pivot-wires for the flaps will be placed. Be careful
not to connect any flap-stops in such a way that
they cross the horizontal open spaces in which you
later will attach the flap pivot-wires.

d. Put aside the flaps and their pivot-wires for
use after you have attached the flap-stops and the
hinges to the frame, as described below.
e. Using the ruler printed on the edge of this
page, mark the positions of each pivot-wire (the
arrowheads numbered 0, 35/8, 71/4 in.) and the
position of each flap-stop (the four marks between
each pair of numbered arrowheads on this ruler).
All of these positions should be marked both on
the vertical sides of the 36-in.-Iong boards of the
frame and on the vertical brace. Mark the position
of the uppermost pivot-wire (the "0" arrowhead on
this ruler) I 4 in. below the top board to which the
hinges have been attached (see Figs. 9 and 10).ORNL- OWG 66-12330AR
