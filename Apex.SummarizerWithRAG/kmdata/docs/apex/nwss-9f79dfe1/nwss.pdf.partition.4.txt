 against us. Civil defense isat once the most
peaceful and the most effective deterrent of
nuclear war.
Some may argue that the Russians could
evacuate again and again and thus, by forcing us
into similar moves, exhaust us. I believe that in
reality they would anger us sufficiently so that we
would rearm in earnest. That is not what the
Russians want to accomplish.
Others may say that the Russians could strike
without previous evacuation. This couid result in
heavy losses on their part which, I hope, they will
not risk.
Civil defense as here described will not
eliminate the danger of nuclear war. It will con-
siderably diminish its probability.
This book takes a long overdue step in
educating the American people. It does not suggest
that survival is easy. It does not prove that national
survival is possible. But it can save lives and it will
stimulate thought and action which will be crucial
in our two main purposes: to preserve freedom
and to avoid war.

When the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission
authorized me in 1964 to initiate the Civil Defense
Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, one of the
first researchers I recruited was Cresson H. Kearny.
Most of his life has been preparation, unplanned and
planned, for writing this guide to help people unfamiliar
with the effects of nuclear weapons improve their
chances of surviving a nuclear attack. During the past
15years he has done an unequaled amount of practical
field work on basic survival problems, without always
conforming to the changing civil defense doctrine.
