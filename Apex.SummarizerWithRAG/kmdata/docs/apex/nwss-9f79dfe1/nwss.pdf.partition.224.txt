, what is his radiation
dose? Answer: 3 hr x 2 RIhr =6 R.
Finding how long it takes 10 g~t a
certain R dose: If the dose rate is 1.6
RIhr outside and a person is willing
10 take a 6 R dose, how long can he
remain outside? Answer:
6 R + 1.6 Rj hr =3.75 hr =
3 hours and 45 minutes.
Falloutradiationguides for a healthy
person not previously exposed to a
total radiation dose of more than
100 R during a 2-week period:
6 R per day call betolerated for up10
two months withoutlosing the ability
to work.
100R in a week or lessisnot likely10
seriously sicken.
350R in a few days results in a
50-50 chance of dying, under
post-attack conditions.
600 R in a week or less is almost
certain to cause death within a few
weeks.

8. Make the charging-wire by using the full-size,exact-size pattern on the right.
Doorbell wire with an outside diameter of about 1/16 inch is best, but any
lightweight insulated wire,such as part ofa lightweight two-wire extensioncord
splitinhalf, willserve.The illustrated wireismuch thickerthan bellwire.To stop
tape from possibly slipping up or down the wire, use a very little glue.
Ifa verythin plastic has been used for the cover, a sticky pieceoftape may need
to be attached to the end of the bare-ended adjustment thread, so both threads
can be used to hold the charging wire in a desired position.
The best tape to attach to an end of one of the adjustment-threads iscloth duct
tape. A square piece 3/4 inch by 3/4 inch is the sticky base. To keep this tape
sticky (free of paper fibers), the paper on the can should be covered with
transparent tape or varnish. A piece about 1/8 inch by 3/4 inch serves to stick
under one end of the sticky base, to hold the adjustment-thread. A 3/4 inch by
1-1/4 inch rectangular pieceoftape isused to make the finger hold - important
for making adjustments inside a dry-bucket.
Witha needleor pin, make a hole inthe plasticcover 1/2 inchfrom the rim ofthe
can and directly above the upper end of the CENTER LINE between the two
leaves.The CENTER LINE ismarked on the pattern wrapped around the can.
Carefully push the CHARGING-WIRE through this hole (thus stretching the
hole) until all ofthe CHARGING-WIREbelow its Band-Aid-tapestop isinside
the can.
S. With scissors, cut offthe "skirt" ofthe plastic cover until it extends only about
one inch belowthe top ofthe rim ofthe can.
6. Make a notch in the "skirt," about one inch wide, where it fits over the pencil
SEAT attached to the can. The "skirt" in this notched area should be only
about 5/8ofan inch long, measured down from the top ofthe rim ofthe can.
