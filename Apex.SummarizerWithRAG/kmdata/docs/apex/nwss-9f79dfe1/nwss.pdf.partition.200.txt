 in a ventilation opening.
Note in Fig. 19 that the KAP's "fixed"support-
board (a 31/ z-in.-wide board to which its hinges are
attached) is held in a bracket only 2 inches deep. To
prevent too tight a fit in the bracket, besure to place a
1hz-in. shim or spacer (the cardboard back of a
writing tablet will do) between two boards of the
bracket, as illustrated. Also, make spaces about 1/16
inches wide between the lower inner corners of the
stop-blocks and the sides of the outer board. To
prevent your hands from being cut, you should put
tape over the exposed ends of wires near the frame's
outer edges of a KAP that you want to be able to
remove rapidly.

• A KAP provided with quick-removal brackets
can be taken down easily and kept out of the way of
persons passing through its doorway when it isnot in
use. Itcan be kept ina place where peopleare unlikely
to damage it.
• Byinstalling two sets of quick-removal brackets
in opposite shelter openings, you can quickly reverse
the direction in which the KAP pumps air, to take
E. Quick-Removal Brackets
The air-supply KAP that 'pumps air through
your shelter is best held in its pumping position by
mounting it in homemade quick-removal brackets
(see Fig. 19) for the following reasons:
a comfortable hand-hold on which to pull down-
ward, tie two or three overhand knots in a strip of
cloth on the end of the pull-cord.
(Such a "pulley" can also be used to operate a
bail-bucket to remove water or wastes from some
shelters, without anyone having to go outside.)

VI. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE
A. Pumping
Operate your 3-foot KAP by pulling it with an
easy, swinging motion of your arm. To pump the
maximum volume of air, you should pull the KAP
toward you until its frame swings out to an almost-
horizontal position. Then quickly move your hand so
that the pull-cord is kept slackduringtheentire, free-
swinging return stroke. Figure 24 in Section VIII,
LARGE KAPs, illustrates this necessary motion.
Be sure to provide a comfortable hand-hold on
the pull-cord (see Fig. 14). Blisters can be serious
under unsanitary conditions.
To pull a KAP via an overhead pulley with
minimum effort, sit down and pull as If you were
tollinga bell---except that you should raise yourhand
quickly with the return stroke and keep it raised long
enough so that the pull-cord remains slackduringthe
entire return stroke. Or, if the pulley is not overhead,
operate the KAP by swinging your extended arm
back and forth from the shoulder;
B. Placement to Take Advantage of the
Natural Direction of Air Flow
A KAP can pump more air into a shelter if it is
installed so that it pumps air through the shelter in
the direction in which the air naturally flows. Since
this direction can be reversed by a wind change
outdoors.
