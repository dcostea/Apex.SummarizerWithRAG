 your shelter enough window screen or
mosquito netting to cover its openings. Except in
freezing-cold weather, flies and mosquitoes
would soon become a problem in most localities
soon after an attack.
17. Work to complete (1) an expedient ventilating-
cooling pump (a KAP) and (2) the storage of at
least 15 gallons of water per person. This work
should be accomplished by the time your shelter
is completed. Especially in an area of heavy
fallout during warm or hot weather, an earth-
covered, high-protection-factor shelter when full
of people would be useless unless adequately
ventilated and cooled and provided with enough
water.
18. In cold weather, restrict air flow through the
shelter by hanging curtains of plastic or tightly
woven fabric, or by otherwise partially
obstructing its two openings. Always be sure to
leave at leasta few square inches open at thefloor
level of one opening and at the ceiling height of
the other, to provide enough ventilation to
prevent a harmful concentration of exhaled
carbon dioxide. To prevent exhaled water vapor
from wetting clothing and bedding and reducing
its insulatingvalue, keep the ventilation openings
as wide open as possible without causing shelter
temperatures to be intolerably cold.ENTER FROM
