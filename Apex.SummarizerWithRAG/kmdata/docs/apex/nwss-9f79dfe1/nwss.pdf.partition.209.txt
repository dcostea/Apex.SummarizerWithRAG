6. Discuss the problems that arise. The head of the family often can give better
answers if he first discusses the different possible interpretations of some
instructions with other family members, especiallyteenagers.
7, After completing one KFM and learning to use it. if time permits make a
second KFM--that should be a better instrument.

a..IV. What a KFM Is and How It Works
An electrostatic charge is transferred from a homemade electrostatic charging
device to the two aluminum-foil leaves of a KFM by means of its charging-wire.
The charging-wire extends out through the transparent plastic cover ofthe KFM.

2. exposing it to radiation for a specified
time in the location where measurement
of the dose rate is needed -- when
outdoors. positioningthe KFM about 3
ft. above the ground;
If a KFM is made and maintained with the specified dimensions and of the specified
materials. ITSACCURACY ISAUTOMATICALLY AND PERMANENTLY ESTAB-
LISHED BY UNCHANGING LAWS OF NATURE. Unlike factory made radiation
measuring instruments, A KFM NEVER NEEDS TO BECALIBRATED OR TESTED
WITH A RADIATION SOURCE. A KFM isused witha watch and the following table
that is based on numerous calibrations made at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
As will be fully explained later. the radiation dose rate is determined
by:
The millimeter scale is cut out and attached (see photo illustrations on the following
page) to the clear plastic cover of the KFM so that its zero mark is directly above the
two leaves in their discharged position when the KFM is resting on a horizontal
surface. A reading of the separation of the leaves is taken by noting the number of
millimeters that the lower edge ofone leafappears to be on. on one side of the zero
mark on the scale. and almost at the same time noting the number of millimeters
the lower edge of the other leafappears to be on. on the other side of the zero mark.
The sum of these two apparent positions of the lower edges of the two leaves is
called a KFM reading. The drawing appearing after the photo illustrations shows
the loweredges of the leaves of a KFM appearing to be 9 mm on the right of zero and
10on the left, giving a KFM reading of 19mm. (Usually the loweredges of the leaves
are not at the same distance from the zero mark.)
1. charging and reading the KFM before
exposure;
4. calculating. by subtraction. the difference between the reading taken before
exposure and the reading taken after exposure;
3. reading the KFM after its exposure;
Instructions on how to use a KFM are given after those detailing how to make and
charge this fallout meter.
S. using this table to find what the dose rate was during the exposure -- as will be
described later.
