Fig. F.2. Plan and Side View of Multi-
Purpose Emergency Exit Housing, on a Square
Emergency Exit with 34 x 34-Inch .Croes-
Sectional Outside Dimensions.
In Figs. F.2 and F.3, note the eight bevelled
plywood guides, twoonthe insideofeachsideof
the top. These guides are needed so that the top
can be tilted in the position desired, merely by
using a stick to raise it from below. To hold the
top in a tilted or raised position, spacer boards
are placed between the raised top and the upper
edges of a wall or walls, as illustrated by Fig.
FA.increasedairpressureoverand abovethiswall,
forcing more airintotheexitandonthroughthe
shelter. In contrast, if a south wind is blowing,
natural airflow will go in through the shelter's
entry and out through its exit. And if the ad-
justable top still is tilted open to the north as
illustrated, then reduced air pressure over and
above the downwind north wall will "suck" an
increasedairflowoutoftheexitandthroughthe
shelter.
Themeasuredincreases inairflowsthrough
a small shelterresultingfrom thetopofthisexit

an 8-10 mph breeze was blowing. These rather

* Exclusion of rain, snow, and larger dust
and fallout particles. The four 12 x 48-inch
verticalsides of the adjustabletopoverhangthe
exit housing's walls by 6 to 12 inches. Thus the
top serves as a large ventilation hood over the
exit, preventingrain, snow, and larger dust and
fallout particlesfromenteringwhileventilation
is continuing. (To prevent entry of flies and
mosquitoes, an insect SCreen panel, made to fit
overthebottomoftheemergencyexit,shouldbe
kept stored in the shelter until needed. A SCreen
door for the inner entry doorway also should be
stored.Rememberthatinstallingscreensgreatly
reduces natural ventilation airflows.)
* A reliable source ofdaylight. The four 12 x
12-inchwindows ofthis exithousingletenough
daylight into the exit shaft, that is painted
white, to permit a person on the shelter floor
below to read, even for several minutes after
sunset. See:Fig. FA.
