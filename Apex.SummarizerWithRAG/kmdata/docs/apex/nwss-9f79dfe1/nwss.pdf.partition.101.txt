Shelter Sanitation and Preventive Medicine
AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION
Should fallout force Americans to stay crowded
into basements and expedient shelters for days or
weeks, they should protect themselves against the
spread of infectious diseases by taking both
accustomed and unaccustomed preventive measures.
Thousands of our jungle infantrymen in World
War II learned to practice many of the health-
preserving techniques described in this chapter. If
modern medical facilities were temporarily unavail-
able, the prevention of diseases would become much
more important to all of us.
The following infection-preventing measuresare
simple, practical, and require some self-discipline.
The author has observed their practice and has used
them while exploring and soldiering in a number of
jungle, desert, and mountain regions. Ialso have used
these measures while field-testing nuclear war
survival skills in several states.
Basic first aid also would be of increased
importance during a major confrontation or war.·
Good first aid booklets and instructionsare available
in practically all communities, so most first aid
information will not be repeated here.
DISPOSAL OF HUMAN WASTES
To preserve health and morale in a shelter
without a toilet or special chemicals for treatment of
excrement and urine, human wastes should be
removed before they produce much gas. A garbage
can with a lid or a bucketcovered with plasticwillnot
hold the pressurized gas produced by rotting
excrement. The following expedient means of
disposal are listed in increasingorder of effectiveness.
• Use a 5-gallon paint can, a bucket, or a large
waterproof wastebasket to collect both urine and
excrement. Use and keep it near the air-exhaust end
of the shelter. Keep it tightlycovered when not inuse;
a piece of plastic tied over the top keeps out insects
and reduces odors. When such waste containers are
full or begin to stink badly while covered, put them
outside the shelter-still covered to keep out flies.
For some people, especially the aged, bringing a
toilet seat from home would be justified. Padding on
the edge of the bucketalso helps those who have to sit
down. An improvised seat of plywood or board
serves well.
If only one container is available and is almost
filled, periodically dump the wastes outside-unless
fallout is still being deposited.
