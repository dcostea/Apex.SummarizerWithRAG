(Also useful: a 50-ft steel tape and 2 hatchets)
• Materials to build a homemade ventilat-
ing pump (a KAP 24in. wide and 36in. high-see
Appendix B) and to store at least 15 gallons of
water per occupant (see Chapter 8).
4. Desirable muscle-powered tools for building a
12-person, Small-Pole Shelter are listed below.
(Most builders have succeeded without having
this many tools. A backhoe, chain saws, and
other mechanized equipment would be helpful,
but not essential.)
5. To help drain the floor, locate the shelter so that
the original ground level at the entrance isabout
12 inches lower than the original ground level at
the far end of the shelter-unless the location is
in a' very flat area.
6. Stake out the trench for the entire shelter. Even
in very firm ground, if the illustrated 12-person
shelter is being built, make the excavation at the
surface 9 ft 8 in. wide and 18ft long (3 ft longer
than the entire length of the wooden shelter). The
sloping sides of the excavation are necessary,
even in very firm earth, to provide adequate
space for backfilling and tamping. (The trench
illustrated in Fig. A.3.1 is 6 ft 4 in. deep, to
minimize work when providing only for excellent
fallout protection. For improved blast protec-
tion, the trench should be at least 7 ft deep.)
7. Check the squareness of the staked trench outline
by making its diagonals equal.
8. Clear all brush, tall grass, and the like from the
ground, to a distance of 10 ft all around the
staked location-so that later you can easily
shovel loose earth back onto the roof.
9. Ifthe ground isunstable, excavate with sides that
are appropriately less steep.
10. When digging the trench for the shelter, use a
measuring stick 7 ft 8 in. long (the minimum

II. When digging with a shovel, pile the earth dug
from near ground levelabout lOft away from the
edges of the excavation. Earth dug from 5 or 6 ft
below ground levelthencan easily be piled on the
surface only I to 5 ft from the edge of the
excavation.
12. Finish the bottom of the excavation so that it
slopes vertically 1/2 in. per foot of length toward
the entrance, and also slopes toward the central
drain ditch. (Later, sticks covered with porous
fabric should be placed in the ditches, to serve
like a crushed-rock drain leading to a sump.)
