F'ig'. 4. Mechanized Drive Used in Weeks-Long- Durability Tests.
After pumping- for :380 hours (15.8:3 days) at 44 strokes per
minute ag-ainst a pressure differenceof 2.:3in. w.g., the worst worn
spot on any of the 30-gauge steel sheetmetal sealing- strips on the
piston was reduced in thickness from its original 0.0155 in. to
0.0145 in. This worst-spot wear of 0.001 in. is only about a 6%
reduction in thickness. The flap valves functioned as well as when
new. and appeared unworn.
I conclude that this pump would be serviceable after several
months of continuous use-provided it is lubricated after every 24
hours of actual use. as in this durability test. In this test I
lubricated the piston. its "cvlinder's" four walls, and its rod with
Lubriplate :\10. 105, "the original white grease". This non-sticky
"grease-type lubricant" is used extensively, especially to lubricate
internal combustion eng-ines hefore first starting up. Another
builder ofthis model pump found Siloo White Lube, an all-purpose
lithium grease, the best of the lubricants that he tested. Judging
from my prior durability tests, a very lightoil applied daily serves
reasonably well. Ordinary bearing grease is unsatisfactory.
MATERIALS
The following materials (that cost about $65. retail in 1985) are
needed to make and operate the best model of this pump:
Plywood, 3/4-in. exterior: one 4 x 8-ft. sheet (finished on one side,
unwarped).
Plywood, :3/8-in. exterior: 1/4th of a 4 x 8-ft. sheet (finished on one
side: unwarped). (Second choice: 1/4-in. exterior plywood).
Oak board, 3/4 x 1-3/4 in., straight, well seasoned, 4 ft. long, to
make the piston rod. (If oak or other very strong wood is not
available, use a straight fir or pine board.)
Fir or pine board, about 3/4 x 1-3/4 in., 8 ft. long, to make the
piston-rod handle, etc.
28-gauge or lighter galvanized-steel flashing (sold by lumber
yards for roofers), no thicker than 0.016 in.: or galvanized steel
or flashing no thinner than 0.012 in. Or 30 gauge galvanized
steel sheetmetal available in some sheetmetal shops. (Sheet-
metal thicker than 0.016 is not springy enough for making this
pump's near-equivalent of piston rings.) Best to go to a sheet-
metal shop and have:3 stripscut, each 3 in. wide and about:30 in.
long.
Screws, round-headed, zinc-plated wood screws:
22 each of No. 12(2-in. long, 12/32 in. dia.), with flat washers
10each of No. 10 (1-1/2 in. long, with flat washers)
15 each of No.6 (3/4 in. long, with flat washers)
Nails, 4-penny (1-1/2 in.), best cement-coated: 1/4 lb.
Nails, 3-penny (1-1/4 in.). galvanized: 1/4 lb.
Staples (if an oak board for the piston rod is not available), No. 17,
:3/4-in., galvanized)- 1/4 lb.
Tacks, No.6 upholstery, (1/2-in. long): a small container.
Tacks, No.3 upholstery (3/8-in. long): a small container.
Felt, weather stripping, 5/8-in. wide: 10 ft.
Tape, silver duct tape, 2-in. wide: a small roll.
Tape, masking tape, 3/4-in. wide: a small roll.
Adhesive, waterproof: "Liquid Nails", or other all purpose con-
struction adhesive: one approx. l l-oz. tube (for use in caulking
gun).
Epoxy, 5-minute: 2 tubes.
Rubber cement: a small tube.
Sealer (such as polyurethane elear finish.
