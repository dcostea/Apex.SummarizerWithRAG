 table.) A KFM is more accurate
than most civil defense instruments, and its
accuracy is permanently established by the
laws of physics applicable to the specified
dimensionsandothercharacteristicsofitsparts,
and to their positioning relative to each other-
providedthatitismadeand maintainedaccord-
ingto the instructions. Unlike all factory-made
radiation measuring civil defense instruments
that are reliable and available today, a KFM is
charged electrostatically. No battery is needed.
• Additional Advantages of KFMs
* A KFM combines the provenly practical
radiation measuring functions of an electro-
scope and of an ionization chamber having a
specified volume. Electroscopes were the basic
radiationmeasuringinstruments used by scien-
tists' includingNobelLaureateLord Rutherford,
who pioneered studies of atomic nuclei and
radiations. The author is indebted to another
Nobel Laureate physicist, Dr. Luis W. Alvarez,
forthe ideaofmakinga homemadeelectroscope
with two thread-suspended, aluminum-foil
leaves, to measure fallout radiation. Many ex-
cellent and unavoidably expensive dose rate
meters, includingcivildefense instruments, are
ionization chamber devices.
* A KFM, used in conjunction with a
watch, does not have to be charged to any
specified initial reading, or discharged by ex-
posureto radiationtoanyspecifiedfinal reading,
to accurately measure the dose rate during a
time intervalspecified on its attachedtable. Fig.
10.2 illustrates this operational advantage of
KFMs.

Fig. 10.2 Normalized Calibration Points for Two KFMs, Showing the Straight-Line
Relationship Between Milliroentgen Radiation DOSES and Resultant Readings. The
complete instructions for making and using a KFM (see Appendix C) explain how an
operator with a watch can use this instrument to accurately measure DOSE RATES.• Additional Information on Accuracy
and Dependability
* Readers who want additional technical
information on the KFM are advised to buy a
copyof theoriginalOakRidge National Labora-
tory report on this instrument, The KFM, A
Homemade Yet Accurate and Dependable Fallout
Meter (ORNL-5040, CORRECTED), by Cresson
H. Kearny, Paul R. Barnes, Conrad V. Chester,
andMargaretW.Cortner. Date published: Janu-
ary 1978.Copiesaresoldbythe NationalTechni-
cal Information Service, U.S. Department of
Commerce, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield,
Virginia 22161. Since the price continues to
increase, it is best to write first, to learn the
postage-paid cost.
* Civil defense professionals of foreign
countries also have concluded that KFMs have
lifesavingpotential.TheJune 1978SpecialIssue
of The Journal of the Institute of Civil Defence
("The Premier Society of Disaster Studies",
with headquarters in London) was entirely
devoted to the KFM, and gave international
distribution to the original complete instruc-
tions and cut-outpaperpatterns.
