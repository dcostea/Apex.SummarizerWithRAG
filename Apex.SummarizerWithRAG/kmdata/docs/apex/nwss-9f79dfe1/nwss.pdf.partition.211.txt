, while the reader's
eyebrow touches the
upper end of the ruler.
The lower edge of the
right leaf is under 8 on
the scale and the lower
edge of the left leaf is
under 6 on the scale,
giving a KFM reading of
14.
Also note the SEAT, a
piece of pencil taped to
the right side of the can,
opposite the charging
wire. .
C. A Charged KFM. Note
the separation of the
upper edges of its two
leaves. The charging-
wire has been raised to
an almost horizontal pos-
ition so that its lower end
is too far above the alu-
minum leaves to permit
electrical leakage from
the leaves back up the
charging-wire and into
the outside air;
The high-voltage electro-
static charge on the un-
wound tape (that is an
insulator) jumps the
spark-gap between the
tape and the upper end of
the charging-wire, and
then flows down the
charging-wire to charge
the insulated aluminum-
foil leaves of the KFM.
(Since the upper edges of
the two leaves are ~ inch
below the scale and this
is a photo taken at an
angle, both leaves appear
to be under the right side
of the scale.)
A. An Uncharged KFM. The charging wire has been pulled to one side by its
adjustment-thread. This
photo was taken looking
straight down at the
upper edges of the two
flat, 8-ply aluminum
leaves. At this angle the
leaves are barely visible,
hanging vertically side by
side directly under the
zero mark, touching each
other and with their ends
even. Their suspension-
threads insulate the
leaves. These threads
are almost parallel and
touch (but do not cross)
each other where they
extend over the top of the
rim of the can.
B. Charging a KFM by a Spark-Gap Discharge from a Tape That Has Been
Electrostatically Charged by Being Unwound Quickly. Note that the charged
tape is moved so that its
surface is perpendicular
to the charging-wire.C\J

A. "or the K/-M: (In the lollowlllg list. when more than one alternative material is gi\en. the best
material is listed first.)
I. Any type metal can. approximately 2-9 Ih inches indiameter insideand 2-7 Xinches high inside.
washed dean with soap. (This is the sile of a standard X-ounce can. Since most soup cans. pop
cans. and beer cans also arc about 2-9/ Ih inches in diameter inside. the required si/e of can also
can be made bycutting down the height of more widelyavailable cans as described in Section
IX of these instructions.)
2. Standard aluminum foil - 2 square feet. (In 1987.2 square feet of widely sold U.S.
brands of aluminum foil weighed between 8.0 and 8.5 grams. One gram equals 0.035
ounce.) (If only "Heavy Duty" or "Extra Heavy Duty" aluminum foil isavailable. make 5-ply
leaves rather than S-ply leaves of standard foil: the resultant fallout meter will be almost as
accurate.)
3. Doorbell-wire. or other light insulated wire (preferably but not necessarily a single-strand wire
inside the insulation h inches.
4. Any type of clean, fine thread that has not been anti-static treated will serve to
suspend a KFM's leaves.
