KEARNY\nCivil Defense Consultant, Retired\nA LETTER TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FROM CRESSON KEARNY, INVENTOR OF THE KFM \nDear Reader, \nAt the time I developed the Kearny Fallout Meter with help from U.S. Department of Energy \nscientists and engineers, we did not address the issue of nuclear terrorism. We were so \nconcerned back then in the 1970\u0027s with the danger of all-out nuclear war that we neglected to \ninstruct users of the KFM of its advantages in a terrorist attack with few and smaller nuclear \nweapons. Fear of life-threatening fallout from massive Soviet attacks carried over to exaggerated \nfears of all radiation, including that from terrorists\u0027 few weapons. \nIn Oak Ridge National Laboratory publications to be read by the public we did not even mention \nhormesis, for to have done so at that time probably would have prevented my most influential book, \n\u0022Nuclear War Survival Skills,\u0022 from being purchased and used by government agencies to instruct \ncivil defense professionals. \nWhen Hitler first bombed London the panic the bombs caused did far more damage than the bombs \nthemselves. After the citizens of London lost their exaggerated fears of the bombings, life went on \nmuch as normal. And so it would be with a nuclear terrorist attack on the U.S. One nuclear bomb \nexploded in a U.S. city would likely be very small. And though it could do catastrophic damage in a \nsmall area, its relative impact on the physical infrastructure of the whole United States would be \nextremely small. However, because of the irrational, universal fear people have of any radioactivity, \nthe panic that would ensue from such an attack would do far more damage than the attack itself. \nAfter the disintegration of the Soviet Union we should have stressed in the KFM instructions that \nsmall doses of radioactivity are hormetic, healthful because they stimulate the immune system. This \nwas proven in laboratories as far back as the 1920\u0027s. With the advent of the A-bomb almost all the \nhormetic research stopped. And only in the last decade has it resumed on a serious scale. \nIn the KFM instructions it was assumed that no medical help would be available during and after a \nnuclear war. The doses that an individual can take under those circumstances without being injured \nare lower than what that individual can withstand if he has medical assistance such as antibiotics, \netc. In a nuclear terrorist attack medical aid would still be available to the majority of American \ncitizens; therefore they could withstand somewhat larger radiation doses. This would enable them \nto carry on with the daily necessities of life in most areas. If we allow irrational fear and panic \nto shut down trucking, communications, and vital services, the disaster will be far greater than \nit needs to be. \nAssembling a KFM and learning to use it before you need it will help you lose irrational fear of \nradioactivity. You will not be paralyzed by panic in an emergency. You will know how to conduct \nyourself in a manner that may not only save your life but also the lives of many of those around \nyou as well. \nI urge you to study the KFM instructions now and make an instrument. You should realize that \nunder terrorist attack conditions the radiation doses you can receive without being incapacitated \nare higher than under nuclear wartime conditions. So you can go to work, drive your truck or car, \nor assist others. \nSincerely, \nCresson H. Kearny [Signiture in his handwritting]\nCresson H.

It brings togetherfield-\ntested instructions that, if followed by a large\nfraction of Americans during a crisis that pre-\ncedes an attack, could save millions of lives.\nThe author is convinced that the vulnerability\nespecially of Americans to nuclear threat or\nattack must be reduced and that the wide dis-\nsemination of the information contained in this\nbook will help preserve peace with freedom.\nUnderlying the advocacy of Americans learning\nthese down-to-earth survival skills is the belief that if\none prepares for the worst. the worst is less likely to\nhappen. Effective American civil defense preparations\nwould reduce the probability of nuclear blackmail and\nwar. Yet in our world of increasing dangers, it is\nsignificant that the United States spends much less per\ncapita on civil defense than many other countries. The\nUnited States\u0027 annual funding is about 50 cents per\ncapita, and only a few cents of this is spent on\nwar-related civil defense. Unless U.S. civil de-\nfense policies are improved, you are unlikely to\nreceive from official sources much of the sur-\nvival information given in this book.\nOver400,000copiesofthe Oak Ridge Nation-\nal Laboratory original 1979 edition of Nuclear\nWar Survival Skills have been sold by various\nprivate publishers. A few additions and modifi-\ncations, some helpful and others harmful, were\nmade in several of these private printings. This\nupdated and expanded edition is needed because\nof changes in nuclear weapons and strategies\nbetween 1979 and 1987, and because of improve-\nments in self-help survival equipment and in-\nstructions.\nThe 1987 edition provides current informa-\ntion on how the Soviet Union\u0027s continuing de-\nployment of smaller, more accurate, more\nnumerous warheads should affect your shelter-\nbuilding and evacuation plans.\nIn the first chapter the myths and facts about the\nconsequences of a massive nuclearattack are discussed.\nTwo post-1979 myths have been added: the myth\nof blinding post-attack increased ultra-violet\nsunlight. and the myth of unsurvivable \u0022nuclear\nwinter\u0022 - along with refuting facts.\nA new chapter, \u0022Permanent Family Fallout\nShelters for Dual Use\u0022, has been added, because\nthe author has received many requests for\ninstructions for buildingpermanentsmall shel-\nters better and less expensive than those de-\nscribed in official civil defense hand-outs.\nAnother new chapter, \u0022Trans-Pacific Fallout\u0022,\ntells how to reduce radiation dangers that you\nwill face if one or more nations use nuclear\nweapons, but none are exploded on America.\nImprovedinstructions aregivenfor making\nand using a KFM, based on the findings of\nnumerous builders since 1979. (The KFM still is\nthe only accurate and dependable fallout radia-\ntion meter that millions of average people can\nmake for themselves in a few hours, using only\ncommon household materials - if they have\nthese improved instructions with patterns.)\nField-tested instructions for easily made Direc-\ntional Fans, the simplest means for pumping\nair, have been added to the \u0022Ventilation and\nCooling of Shelters\u0022 chapter. Also included in\nthis book are scores of other new facts and\nupdatings likely to help save lives if nuclear\nwar strikes.\nA new appendix gives instructions for a\nhomemakeable Plywood Double-Action Piston\nPump, inspired by a wooden air pump the\nauthor saw being used in China in 1982.\nThis first-of-its-kind book is primarily a\ncompilation and summary of civil defense\nmeasures developed at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory and elsewhere over the past 24\nyears, and field tested by typical untrained\nAmericans in many states, from Florida to\nWashington. The reader is urged to make at least\nsome of these low-cost preparations before a crisis\narises. The main emphasis, however, is on survival\npreparations that could be made in the last few days of\na worsening CrISIS.\nThe author wrote the original, uncopy-\nrighted Nuclear War Survival Skills while working\nas a research engineer at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory.

Russian official policy holds that civil\ndefense isfeasible even in anuclear war. American\nofficial policy, or at any rate the implementation of\nthat policy, is based on the assumption that civil\ndefense is useless.\nThe Russians, having learned a bitter lesson in\nthe second world war, have bent every effort to\ndefend their people under all circumstances. They\nare spending several billion dollars per year on this\nactivity. They have effective plans to evacuate their\ncities before they let loose a nuclear strike. They\nhave strong shelters for the people who must\nremain in the cities:They are building up protected\nfood reserves to tide them over a critical period.\nAll this may mean that in a nuclear exchange,\nwhich we must try to avoid or to deter, the Russian\ndeaths would probably not exceed ten million.\nTragic assuch a figure is, the Russian nation would\nsurvive. If they succeed in eliminating the United\nStates they can commandeer food, machinery and\nmanpower from the rest of the world. They could\nrecover rapidly. They would have attained their\ngoal: world domination.\nIn the American view the Russian plan is\nunfeasible. Those who argue on this side point out\nthe great power of nuclear weapons. In this they\nare right. Their argument is particularly impressive\nin its psychological effect.\nBut this argument has never been backed up\nby a careful quantitative analysis which takes into\naccount the planned dispersal and sheltering of\nthe Russian population and the other measures\nwhich the Russians have taken and those to which\nthey are committed.\nThat evacuation of our own citizens can be\nextremely useful if we see that the Russians are\nevacuating is simple common sense. With the use\nof American automobiles an evacuation could be\nfaster and more effective than is possible in Russia.\nTo carry it out we need not resort to the totalitarian\nmethods of the iron curtain countries. It will suffice\nto warn our people and advise them where to go,\nhow to protect themselves. The Federal Emergency\nManagement Administration contains the begin-\nnings on which such a policy might be built.\nThe present book does not,and indeed cannot,\nmake the assumption that such minimal yet\nextremely useful government guidance will be\navailable. Instead it outlines the skills that in-\ndividuals or groups of individuals can learn and\napply in order to improve their chances of survival.\nThis book is not adescription of civil defense.\nIt is a guide to \u0022Stop-gap\u0022 civil defense which\nindividuals could carry out for themselves, if need\nbe, with no expenditures by our government. It\nfills the gap between the ineffective civil defense\nthat we havetoday and the highly effective survival\npreparations that we could and should have a few\nyears from now. However, if we go no further than\nwhat we can do on the basisof this book, then the\nUnited States cannot survive a major nuclear war.\nYet this book, besides being realisticand objec-\ntively correct, serves two extremely important pur-\nposes. One is: it will help to save lives. The second\npurpose is to show that with relatively inexpensive\ngovernmental guidance and supplies, an educated\nAmerican public could, indeed, defend itself. We\ncould survive a nuclear war and remain a nation.\nThis is an all-important goal. Its most practical\naspect lies in the fact that the men in the Kremlin\nare cautious. If they cannot count on destroying us\nthey probably will never launch their nuclear\narsenal against us. Civil defense isat once the most\npeaceful and the most effective deterrent of\nnuclear war.\nSome may argue that the Russians could\nevacuate again and again and thus, by forcing us\ninto similar moves, exhaust us. I believe that in\nreality they would anger us sufficiently so that we\nwould rearm in earnest. That is not what the\nRussians want to accomplish.\nOthers may say that the Russians could strike\nwithout previous evacuation. This couid result in\nheavy losses on their part which, I hope, they will\nnot risk.\nCivil defense as here described will not\neliminate the danger of nuclear war. It will con-\nsiderably diminish its probability.\nThis book takes a long overdue step in\neducating the American people. It does not suggest\nthat survival is easy. It does not prove that national\nsurvival is possible. But it can save lives and it will\nstimulate thought and action which will be crucial\nin our two main purposes: to preserve freedom\nand to avoid war.\nEdward Teller","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":8,"content":"Nuclear War Survival Skills Video Tapes\nThe Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine, which distributes extensive written, audio, and video information on ex-\npedient and permanent civil defense procedures and preparations, has produced a series offourvideotapes inwhich the field\ntested instructions in Nuclear WarSurvival Skills and facts about nuclear weapons effects are demonstrated by civil defense\nvolunteers including demonstrations and explanations by Cresson H.

Kearny.\nMost of his life has been preparation, unplanned and\nplanned, for writing this guide to help people unfamiliar\nwith the effects of nuclear weapons improve their\nchances of surviving a nuclear attack. During the past\n15years he has done an unequaled amount of practical\nfield work on basic survival problems, without always\nconforming to the changing civil defense doctrine.\nAfter I returned to my professional duties at\nPrinceton in 1966, the civil defense effort at Oak Ridge\n:\\ational Laboratory was first headed by James C.\nBresee. and is nowheaded by Conrad V. Chester. Both\nhave wholeheartedly supported Kearny\u0027s down-to-\nearth research. and Chester was not only a co-\ndeveloper of several of the survival items described in\nthis book, but also participated in the planning of the\nexperiments testing them.\nKearny\u0027s concern with nuclear war dangers began\nwhile he was studying for his degree in civil engineering\nat Princeton - he graduated summa cum laude in\n1937. His Princeton studies had already acquainted\nhim with the magnitude of an explosion in which\nnuclear energy is liberated, then only a theoretical\npossibility. After winning a Rhodes Scholarship,\nKearny earned two degrees in geology at Oxford. Still\nbefore the outbreak of World War II. he observed the\neffective preparations made in England to reduce the\neffects of aerial attacks. He had a deep aversion to\ndictatorships, whetherfrom the right or left, and during\nthe \\1 unich crisis he acted as a courier for an un-\nderground group helping anti-Nazis escape from\nCzechoslovakia.\nFollowing graduation from Oxford, Kearny did\ngeological exploration work in the Andes of Peru and\nin the jungles of Venezuela. He has traveled also in\nMexico, China. and the Philippines.\nA year before Pearl Harbor, realizing that the\nUnited States would soon be at war and that ourjungle\ntroops should have at least as good personalequipment.\nfood, and individual medical suppliesas do exploration\ngeologists. he quit his job with the Standard Oil\nCompany of Venezuela. returned to the United States,\nand went on active duty as an infantry reserve lieutenant.\nKearny was soon assigned to Panama as the Jungle\nExperiment Officer of the Panama Mobile Force. In\nthat capacity he was able to improve orinvent, and then\nthoroughly jungle-test, much of the specialized equip-\nment and rations used by our jungle infantrymen in\nWorld War II. Forthis work he was promoted to major\nand awarded the Legion of Merit.\nTo take his chances in combat, in 1944 the author\nvolunteered for duty with the Office of Strategic\nServices. As a demolition specialist helping to limit the\nJapanese invasion then driving into the wintry moun-\ntains of southern China, he saw mass starvation and\ndeath first hand. Theexperiencesgained in this capacity\nalso resulted in an increased understanding of both the\nphysical and emotional problems of people whose\ncountry is under attack.\nWorry about the increasing dangers of nuclear\nwar and America\u0027s lack of civil defense caused the\nauthor in 1961 to consult Herman Kahn. a leading\nnuclear strategist. Kahn, who was at that time forming\na nonprofit war-research organization, the Hudson\nInstitute, offered him work as a research analyst. Two\nyears of civil defense research in this\u0022think tank\u0022made\nthe author much more knowledgeable of survival\nproblems.\nIn 1964 he joined the Oak Ridge civil defense\nproject and since then Oak Ridge has been Kearny\u0027s\nbase of operations, except for two years during the\nheight of the Vietnam war. For his Vietnam work on\ncombat equipment, and also for his contributions to\npreparations for improvingsurvivability in the event of\na nuclear war, he received the Army\u0027s Decoration for\nDistinguished Civilian Service in 1972.\nThis book draws extensively on Kearny\u0027s under-\nstanding of the problems of civil defense acquired as a\nresult of his own field testing of shelters and other\nsurvival needs, and also from an intensive study of the\nserious civil defense preparations undertaken by other\ncountries. including Switzerland. Sweden, the USSR,\nand China. He initiated and edited the Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory translations of Soviet civil defense\nhandbooks and of a Chinese manual. and gained\nadditional knowledge from these new sources. Trips to\nEngland, Europe, and Israel also expanded his infor-\nmation on survival measures. which contributed to the\nNuclear War Survival Skills. However, the book\nadvocates principally those do-it-yourself instructions\nthat field tests have proved to be practical.\nEugene P. Wigner, Physicist.

OurGovern-\nment continues to downgrade war-related sur-\nvival preparations and spends only a few cents\na yearto protecteach Americanagainst possible\nwardangers. Duringthe 10yearsormore before\nthe Strategic Defense Initiative (Star Wars)\nweapons can be invented, developed and de-\nployed, self-help civil defense will continue to\nbe your main hope of surviving if we suffer a\nnuclear attack.\nMost Americans hope that Star Wars will\nlead to the deployment of new weapons capable\nof destroying attacking missiles and warheads\nin flight. However, no defensive system can be\nmade leak-proof. If Star Wars, presently only a\nresearch project, leads to a deployed defensive\nsystem, then self-help civil defense will be a\nvital part of our hoped for, truly defensive\nsystem to prevent aggressions and to reduce\nlosses if deterrence fails.\nPURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THIS BOOK\nThis book iswritten for the majority of Americans\nwho want to improve their chances of surviving a\nnuclear war. It brings together field-tested instructions\nthat have enabled untrained Americans to make\nexpedient fallout shelters, air pumps to ventilate and\ncool shelters, fallout meters, and other expedient life-\nsupport equipment.

Also\ndescribed are expedient ways to remove even\ndissolved radioiodinefrom water, and to process\nand cook whole grains and soybeans, our main\nfood reserves. Successive versions of these\ninstructions have been used successfully by\nfamilies working under simulated crisis condi-\ntions, and have been improved repeatedly by\nOak Ridge National Laboratory civil defense\nresearchers and others over a periodof 14years.\nThese improved instructions are the heart of\nthis updated 1987 edition of the original Oak\nRidge National Laboratory survival book first\npublished in 1979.\nThe average American has far too little informa-\ntion that would help him and his family and our\ncountry survive a nuclear attack, and many of his\nbeliefsabout nuclearwar are bothfalseand dangerous.\nSince the A-bomb blasted Hiroshima and hurled\nmankind into the NuclearAge,only duringa recognized\ncrisis threatening nuclear war have most Americans\nbeen seriously interested in improving their chances of\nsurviving a nuclear attack. Both during and following\nthe Cuban MissileCrisis in 1962, millions of Americans\nbuilt fallout shelters or tried to obtain survival infor-\nmation. At that time most of the available survival\ninformation was inadequate, and dangerouslyfaulty in\nsome respects - as it still is in 1987. Widespread\nrecognition of these civil defense shortcomings has\ncontributed to the acceptance by most Americans of\none or both of two false beliefs:\nOne of these false beliefs isthat nuclear war would\nbe such a terrible catastrophe that it isan unthinkable\nimpossibility. If this were true, there would be no\nlogical reason to worry about nuclear war or to make\npreparations to survive a nuclear attack.\nThe second false beliefisthat, ifa nuclearwar were\nto break out, it would be the end of mankind. If this\nwere true, a rational person would not try to improve\nhis chances of surviving the unsurvivable.\nThis book gives facts that show these beliefs are\nfalse. History shows that once a weapon is invented it\nremains ready for use in the arsenals of some nations\nand in time will be used. Researchers who have spent\nmuch time and effort learningthe facts about effects of\nnuclear weapons now know that all-out nuclear war\nwould not be the end of mankind or of civilization.\nEven ifour country remained unprepared and were to\nbesubjected to an all-out nuclearattack, many millions\nof Americans would survive and could livethrough the\ndifficult post-attack years.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":12,"content":"WHY YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND\nALMOST ALL OTHER AMERICANS ARE\nLEFT UNPROTECTED HOSTAGES TO THE\nSOVIET UNION\nUnknown to most Americans, our Govern-\nment lacks the defense capabilities that would\nenablethe UnitedStatestostopbeingdependent\non a uniquely American strategic policy called\nMutualAssuredDestruction(MAD).MADmain-\ntains thatif boththe UnitedStatesandRussiado\nnot or can not adequately protect their people\nandessentialindustries,thenneitherwillattack\nthe other.\nAn influential minority of Americans still\nbelievethat protectingourcitizens andourvital\nindustries would accelerate the arms race and\nincrease the risk of war.

Almost all Russians have\ncompulsory instructionto teach them aboutthe\neffects of nuclear and other mass-destruction\nweapons, and whatthey can do to improve their\nchances of surviving. Comprehensive prepara-\ntions have been made for the crisis evacuation\nof urban Russians to rural areas, where they\nand ruralRussians wouldmakehigh-protection-\nfactor expedient fallout shelters. Blast shelters\nto protect millions have been built in the cities\nand near factories where essential workers\nwould continue production during a crisis.\nWheat reserves and other foods for war sur-\nvivors have been stored outside target areas.\nAbout 100,000 civil defense troops are main-\ntained for control, rescue, and post-attack re-\ncovery duties. The annual per capita cost of\nRussian civil defense preparations, if made at\ncosts equivalentto those inthe United States, is\nvariously estimated to be between $8 and $20.\nSwitzerland has the best civil defense sys-\ntem, one that already includes blast shelters for\nover85 percent of all its citizens. Swiss invest-\nment in this most effective kind of war-risk\ninsurance has continued steadily for decades.\nAccording to Dr. Fritz Sager, the Vice Director\nof Switzerland\u0027s civil defense, in 1984 the cost\nwas the equivalent of $12.60 per capita.\nIncontrast,ourFederalEmergencyManage-\nment Agency, that includes nuclear attack\npreparedness among its many responsibilities,\nwill receive only about $126 million in fiscal\n1987.

However, the mea-\nsures put into effect during such a crisis can be\nvery much more effective if plans and some\npreparations are completed well in advance.

(This is the demoralizing\nmessage of On the Beach and many similar pseudo-\nscientific books and articles.)\n\u2022 Facts: When a nuclear weapon explodes near\nenough to the ground for its fireball to touch the\nground, it forms a crater.

Thou-\nsands of tons of the particles are carried up into a\nmushroom-shaped cloud, miles above the earth.\nThese radioactive particles then fall out of the\nmushroom cloud, or out of the dispersing cloud of\nparticles blown by the winds-thus becoming fallout.\nEach contaminated particle continuouslygivesoff\ninvisible radiation, much like a tiny X-ray machine-\nwhile in the mushroom cloud, while descending, and\nafter having fallen to earth.

Many smaller\nparticles are carried by the winds for tens to thousands\nof miles before falling to earth. At anyone place where\nfallout from a singleexplosion isbeingdeposited on the\nground in concentrations high enough to require the\nuse of shelters, deposition will be completed within a\nfew hours.\nThe smallest fallout particles-those tiny enough\nto be inhaled into a person\u0027s lungs-are invisible to the\nnaked eye. These tiny particles would fall so slowly\nfrom the four-mile or greater heights to which\n1000 1000 R/hr\n1 hr AFTER\n900\n800\n700\n.c 6002\nw\nI- 500\u003Cta:W(J)\n0 4000\n300\n200\n100\nthey would be injected by currently deployed\nSoviet warheads that most would remain air-\nborne for weeks to years before reaching the\nground.Bythattimetheirextremelywidedisper-\nsal and radioactive decay would make them\nmuch lessdangerous.

The radioactive\ndecay, as this lessening iscalled, is rapid at first, then\ngets slower and slower. The dose rate (the amount of\nradiation received per hour) decreases accordingly.\nFigure 1.2\u0027 illustrates the rapidity of the decay of\nradiation from fallout during the first two days after\nthe nuclear explosion that produced it. R stands for\nroentgen, a measurement unit often used to measure\nexposure to gamma rays and X rays. Fallout meters\ncalled dosimeters measure the dose received by\nrecording the number of R. Fallout meters called\nsurvey meters, or dose-rate meters, measure the dose\nrate by recording the number of R being received per\nhour at the time of measurement. Notice that it takes\nabout seven times as long for the dose rate to decay\nORNL\u00B7DWG 78-6265\n48\nHOURS AFTER THE EXPLOSION\nFig. 1.2.

(Only in high-fallout areas would the dose\nrate I hour after the explosion be as high as 1000\nroentgens per hour.)\nIf the dose rate I hour after an explosion is 1000\nR hr, it would take about 2weeks for the dose rate to\nbe reduced to I R/ hr solely as a result of radioactive\ndecay. Weathering effects will reduce the dose rate\nfurther; for example, rain can wash fallout particles\nfrom plants and houses to lower positions on or\ncloser to the ground. Surrounding objects would\nreduce the radiation dose from these low-lying\nparticles.\nFigure 1.2 also illustrates the fact that at a\ntypical location where agiven amount offalloutfrom\nan explosion is deposited later than I hour after the\nexplosion, the highest dose rate and the total dose\nreceived at that location are less than at a location\nwhere the same amount of fallout isdeposited I hour\nafter the explosion. The longer fallout particles have\nbeen airborne before reaching the ground, the less\ndangerous is their radiation.\nWithin two weeks after an attack the occupants\nof most shelters could safely stop using them, or\ncould work outside the shelters for an increasing\nnumber of hours each day. Exceptions would be in\nareas of extremely heavy fallout such as might occur\ndownwind from important targets attacked with\nmany weapons, especially missile sites and very large\ncities. To know when to come out safely, occupants\neither would need a reliable fallout meter to measure\nthe changing radiation dangers, or must receive\ninformation based on measurements made nearby\nwith a reliable instrument.\nThe radiation dose that will kill a person varies\nconsiderably with different people. A dose of 450 R\nresulting from exposure of the whole body to fallout\nradiation is often said to be the dose that will kill\nabout half the persons receiving it, although most\nstudies indicate that it would take somewhat less.\u0027\n(Note: A number written after a statement refers the\nreader to a source listed in the Selected References\nthat follow Appendix D.) Almost all persons\nconfined to expedient shelters after a nuclear attack\nwould be under stress and without clean surround-\nings or antibiotics to fight infections. Many also\nwould lack adequate water and food. Under these\nunprecedented conditions, perhaps half the persons\nwho received a whole-body dose of 350 R within a few\ndays would die.\u0027\nFortunately, the human body can repair most\nradiation damage if the daily radiation doses are not\ntoo large. As will be explained in Appendix B, a\nperson who is healthy and has not been exposed in\nthe past two weeks to a total radiation dose of more\nthan 100 R can receive a dose of 6 R each day for at\nleast two months without being incapacitated.\nOnly a very small fraction of Hiroshima and\nNagasaki citizens who survived radiation doses-\nsome of which were nearly fatal-have suffered\nserious delayed effects. The reader should realize that\nto do essential work after a massive nuclear attack,\nmany survivors must be willing to receive much\nlarger radiation doses than are normally permissible.\nOtherwise, too many workers would stay inside\nshelter too much of the time, and work that would be\nvital to national recovery could not be done. For\nexample, if the great majority of truckers were so\nfearful of receiving even non-incapacitating radiation\ndoses that they would refuse to transport food,\nadditional millions would die from starvation alone.\n\u2022 Myth: Fallout radiation penetrates everything;\nthere is no escaping its deadly effects.\n\u2022 Facts: Some gamma radiation from fallout will\npenetrate the shielding materials of even an excellent\nshelter and reach its occupants. However, the\nradiation dose\u0027 that the occupants of an excellent\nshelter would receive while inside this shelter can be\nreduced to a dose smaller than the average American\nreceives during his lifetime from X rays and other\nradiation exposures normal in America today. The\ndesign features of such a shelter include the use of a\nsufficient thickness of earth or other heavy shielding\nmaterial. Gamma rays are like X rays, but more\npenetrating. Figure 1.3 shows how rapidly gamma\nrays are reduced in number (but not intheirability to\npenetrate) by layers of packed earth. Each of the\nlayers shown is one halving-thickness of packed\nearth-about 3.6 inches (9 centimeters).\u0027 A halving-\nthickness is the thickness of a material which reduces\nby half the dose of radiation that passes through it.\nThe actual paths ofgamma rays passingthrough\nshielding materials are much more complicated, due\nto scattering, etc., than are the straight-line paths\nshown in Fig. 1.3. But when averaged out, the\neffectiveness of a halving-thickness of any material is\napproximately as shown. The densera substance, the\nbetter it serves for shielding material.

This was true even though these long, large\nshelters lacked blast doors and were deep inside the\nzone within which all buildings weredestroyed.

Persons inside so small a shelterwithouta\nblast door would have been killed by blast pressure at\nthis distance from the explosion.

Yet\nobservations that they cited showed no reduc-\ntions in ozone. Nor did ultraviolet increase.\nOther theoreticians calculated sizeable reduc-\ntions in total ozone, but interpreted the obser-\nvational data to indicate either no reduction, or\nmuch smaller reductions than their calculated\nones.\nA realistic simplified estimate of the in-\ncreased ultraviolet light dangers to American\nsurvivors of a large nuclear war equates these\nhazards to moving from San Francisco to sea\nlevel at the equator, where the sea level inci-\ndenceof skincancers(seldomfatal) ishighest-\nabout 10 times higher than the incidence at San\nFrancisco.Manyadditionalthousandsof Ameri-\ncan survivors might get skin cancer, but little\nor no increase in skin cancers might result if in\nthe post-attack world deliberate sun tanning\nand going around hatless went out of fashion.\nFurthermore, almost all of today\u0027s warheads\nare smaller than those exploded in the large-\nweapons tests mentioned above; most would\ninject much smaller amounts of ozone-destroy-\ning gasses, or no gasses, into the stratosphere,\nwhere ozone deficiencies may persistfor years.\nAndnuclearweapons smallerthan500 kilotons\nresult in increases (due to smog reactions) in\nupper tropospheric ozone.

Terror, a self-destructive\nemotion, is almost always the result of unexpected\ndanger. Some people would think the end of the\nworld was upon them if they happened to be in an\narea downwind from surface bursts of nuclear\nweapons that sucked millions of tons of pulverized\nearth into the air. They might give up all hope ifthey\ndid not understand what they saw. People are more\nlikely to endure and survive if they learn in advance\nthat such huge dust clouds, particularly ifcombined\nwith smoke from great fires, may turn day into\nnight-as have some volcanic eruptions and the\nlargest forest fires.\nPeople also should expect thunder to crash in\nstrange clouds, and the earth to shake. The sky may\nbe lit with the flickering purples and greens of\n\u0022artificial auroras\u0022 caused by nuclear explosions,\nespecially those that are miles above the earth.\nFEAR\nFear often is a life-saving emotion. When we\nbelieve death is close at hand, fear can increase our\nability to work harder and longer. Driven byfear, we\ncan accomplish feats that would be impossible\notherwise. Trembling hands, weak legs, and cold\nsweat do not mean that a person has become\nineffective. Doing hard, necessary work isone of the\nbest ways to keep one\u0027s fears under control.\nBrave men and women who are self-confident\nadmit their fears, even when the threat of death is\nremote. Then they plan and work to lessen the causes\nof their fears. (When the author helped Charles A.\nLindbergh design a reinforced-concrete blast shelter\nfor his family and neighbors, Lindbergh frankly\nadmitted that hefeared both nuclearattackand being\ntrapped. He was able to lessen both of these fears by\nbuilding an excellent blast shelter with two escape\nopenings.)\nTERROR\nIf the danger is unexpected enough or great\nenough, normal persons sometimesexperience terror\nas well as fear. Terror prevents the mind from\nevaluatingdangersand thinking logically. Itdevelops\nin two stages, which have been described by Dr. Walo\nvon Gregerz, a physician with much war experience,\nin his book Psychology ofSurvival. The first stage is\napathy: people become indifferentto their own safety\nand are unable even to try to save themselves or their\nfamilies. The second stage is a compulsion to flee.\nAnxiety, fear, and terror can result insymptoms\nvery similar to those caused by radiation injury:\nnausea, vomiting, extreme trembling, diarrhea. Dr.\nvon Gregerz has described terror as being \u0022explo-\nsively contagious.\u0022 However, persons who learn to\nunderstand the nature of our inherent human traits\nand behavior and symptoms are lesslikely to become\nterrorized and ineffective in the event of a nuclear\nattack.\nEMOTIONAL PARALYSIS\nThe most common reaction to great danger is\nnot terror, but a kind of numbing of the emotions\nwhich actually may be helpful.

They forget\nthe history of great human catastrophes and the self-\nsacrificing strengths most human beings are capable\nof displaying. After a massive nuclear attack\nstarvation would afflict some areas, but America\u0027s\ngrain-producing regions still would have an abun-\ndance of uncontaminated food. History indicates\nthat Americans in the food-rich areas would help the\nstarving. Like the heroic Russians who drove food\ntrucks to starving Leningrad through bursting Nazi\nbombs and shells;\u0027 many Americans would risk\nradiation and other dangers to bring truckloads of\ngrain and other necessities to their starving country-\nmen. Surely, an essential part of psychological\npreparations for surviving a modern war is a well-\nfounded assurance that many citizens of a strong\nsociety will struggle to help each other and will work\ntogether with little regard for danger and loss.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":28,"content":"Chapter 3\nWarnings and Communications\nIMPORTANCE OF ADEQUATE WARNING\nWhen Hiroshima and Nagasaki were blasted by\nthe first nuclear weapons ever to be used in war, very\nfew of the tens of thousands of Japanese killed or\ninjured were inside their numerous air raid shelters.\nThe single-plane attacks caught them by surprise.\nPeople are not saved by havingshelters nearby unless\nthey receive warning in time to reach their shelters-\nand unless they heed that warning.\nTYPES OF WARNINGS\nWarnings are of two types, strategicand tactical.\n\u2022 Strategic warning is based on observed enemy\nactions that are believed to be preparations for an\nattack. For example, we would have strategic\nwarning if powerful Russian armies were advancing\ninto western Europe and Soviet leaders were\nthreatening massive nuclear destruction if the\nresisting nations should begin to use tactical nuclear\nweapons. With strategic warning beinggiven by news\nbroadcasts and newspapers over a period of days,\nAmericans in areas that are probably targeted would\nhave time to evacuate. Given a day or more of\nwarning, tens of millions of uscould build or improve\nshelters and in other ways improve our chances of\nsurviving the feared attack. By doing so, we also\nwould help decrease the risk of attack.\n\u2022 Tactical warning of a nuclear attack on the\nUnited States would be received by our highest\nofficials a few minutes after missiles or other nuclear\nweapons had been launched against our country.\nRadar, satellites, and other sophisticated means of\ndetection would begin to feed information into our\nmilitary warning systems almost at once. This raw\ninformation would have to be evaluated, ami top-\nlevel\u00B7decisions would have to be made. Then attack\nwarnings would have to be transmitted down to com-\nmunities all over America.\nTactical warning (attack warning) of an out-of-\nthe-blue, Pearl-Harbor-type attack would be less\nlikely to be received by the average American than\nwould an attack warning given after recognized\nstrategic warning. However, the short time (only 15to\n40 minutes) that would elapse between missile launch-\nings and the resultant first explosions on targets in the\nUnited States would make it difficult for even an\nexcellent warning system to alert the majority of\nAmericans in time for them to reach the best available\nnearby shelter.\nStrengths and weaknesses of the present official\nwarning system are summarized in the following two\nsections. Then the life-saving warnings that the first\nnuclear explosions would give, especially to informed\npeople, are described.\nOFFICIAL WARNING SYSTEM\nThe U.S. official warning system is designed to\ngivecivilians timely warning by means of siren signals\nand radio and television announcements. The National\nWarning System (NAWAS) is a wire-line network\nwhich is to provide attack information to official\nwarning points nationwide. NA WAS is not pro-\ntected against electromagnetic pulse (EMP)\neffects from nuclear explosions. When the\ninformation is received at warning points by the\nofficials who are responsible, they will sound local\nsirens and initiate radio and TV emergency broad-\ncasts - if power has not failed. Officials at NAWAS\nwarning points include many local civil defense\ndirectors. NAWAS receives information from our","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":29,"content":"constantly improving military warning and commu-\nnications systems.\nSIREN WARNINGS\nThe Attack Warning Signal is a wavering,\nwailing sound on the sirens lasting three to five\nminutes, or a series of short blasts on whistles or\nhorns. After a brief pause, it is repeated. This signal\nmeans only one thing: take protective action-go\npromptly to the best available shelter. Do not try to\ntelephone for information; get information from a\nradio broadcast after you reach shelter. It is Federal\npolicy that the Attack Warning Signal will not be\nsounded unless an enemy attack on the United States\nhas been detected. However, since local authorities\nmay not follow this policy, the reader is advised to\ncheck the plans in his community before a crisis\narrscs.\nThe following limitations of attack warnings\ngiven by sirens and broadcasting stations should be\nrecognized:\n\u2022 Only a relatively small fraction of urban\nAmericans could hear the sirens in the present city\nsystems. especially if most urban citizens had\nevacuated during a crisis.\n\u2022 Except in a crisis threatening the outbreak of\nnuclear war at any moment. most people who would\nhear the attack warning signal either would not\nrecognize it or would not believe it was a warning of\nactual attack.\n\u2022 A coordinated enemy attack may include the\ndetonation of a few submarine-launched ballistic\nmissiles (SLBMs) at high altitudes over the United\nStates within a few minutes of the launching of\nhundreds of SLBMs and intercontinental ballistic\nmissiles (ICBMs). Such high-altitude bursts would\nproduceelectromagnetic pulse (EMP)effectsprimarily\nintended to knock out or disrupt U.S. military com-\nmunications. These EMP effects also could knock out\nthe public power necessary to sound sirens and could\nput most unprotected broadcasting stations off the air.\nRadio warnings and emergency communications\nto thegeneral publicwillbebroadcastbythe Emergency\nBroadcast System(EBS). This system uses AM broad-\ncasting stations as the primary means to reach the\npublic; selected FM and TV stations are included for\nbackup. All stations during a crisis plan to use their\nnormal broadcast frequencies.\nEBS stations that are not put off the air by EMP\nor other effects of early explosions will attempt to\nconfirm the siren warnings of a nuclear attack. They\nwilltry to giveinformation to listeners in the extensive\nareas where sirens and whistles cannot be heard.\nHowever, EMP effects on telephones are likely to\nlimit the information available to the stations. The\nfunctioning EBS stations should be able to warn\nlisteners to seekthe best available nearbyshelterintime\nfor most of these listeners to reach such shelter before\nICBMsbeginto explode. Limitations ofthe Emergency\nBroadcastingSystem inFebruary 1986 includedthe\nfact thatEMPprotectionhadbeencompletedfor\nonly 125 of the approximately 2,771 radio sta-\ntions in the Emergency Broadcast System. One\nhundred and ten of 3,000 existing Emergency\nOperating Centers also had been protected\nagainstEMPeffects. Many ofthe protectedstations\nwould be knocked out by blast; most do not afford\ntheir operating personnel fallout protection that is\nadequate for continuing broadcasts for long in areas\nsubjected to heavy fallout.\nWARNINGS GIVEN BY\nTHE ATTACK ITSELF\nThe great majority of Americans would not be\ninjured by the first explosions of a nuclear attack. In\nan all-out attack, the early explosions would give\nsufficient warning for most people to reach nearby\nshelter in time. Fifteen minutes or more before big\nintercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) blasted\nour cities, missile sites, and other extensive areas,\nmost citizens would see the sky lit up to an\nastounding brightness, would hear the thunderous\nsounds of distant explosions, or would note the\nsudden outage of electric power and most communi-\ncations. These reliable attack warnings would result\nfrom the explosion of submarine-launched ballistic\nmissiles (SLBMs). These are smaller than many\nICBMs. The SLBM warheads would explode on\nStrategic Air Command bases and on many civilian\nairport runways that are long enough to be used by\nour big bombers. Some naval bases and high-priority\nmilitary command and communication centers\nwould also be targeted.\nThe vast majority of Americans do not know\nhow to use these warnings from explosions to help\nthem save their lives. Neitherare they informed about\nthe probable strategies of an enemy nuclear attack.\nOne of the first objectives of a coordinated\nenemy attack would be to destroy our long-range\nbombers, because each surviving U.S. bomberwould\nbe one of our most deadly retaliatory weapons. Once\nbombers are airborne and well away from their\nrunways, they are difficult to destroy. To destroy our","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":30,"content":"bombers before they could get away, the first SLBMs\nwould be launched at the same time that ICBMs\nwould be fired from their silos in Europe and Asia.\nL.S. surveillance systems would detect launchings\nand transmit warnings within a. very few minutes.\nSince some enemy submarines would be only a few\nhundred miles from their targets, some SLBMs\nwould explode on American targets about 15 or 20\nminutes before the first ICBMs would hit.\nSome SLBMs would strike civilian airport\nrunways that are at least 7000 ft long. This is the\nminimum length required by B-52s; there were 210\nsuch runways in the U.S. in 1977. During a crisis, big\nbombers would be dispersed to many of these long\nrunways. and enemy SLBMs would be likely to target\nand hit these runways in an effort to destroy the\nmaximum number of bombers.\nToday most Soviet SLBMs have warheads\nbetween 100 kilotons and one megaton. See\nJane s Weapon Systems, 1987-88. Within 10 to 15\nminutes of the beginning of an attack, runways\n7000 feet or longer are likely to be hit by\nairbursts, to destroy U.S. aircraft and airport\nfacilities. Later cratering explosions may be\nused to destroy surviving long runways, or at\nleast to produce local fallout soheavy that they\ncould not beusedfor severaldaysfor re-arming\nand re-fueling our bombers. Therefore, homes\nwithin about 4 miles of a runway at least 7000 ft long\nare likely to be destroyed before residents receive\nwarning or have time to reach blast shelters away from\ntheir homes. Homes six miles away could be lightly\ndamaged bysuch a warhead, with the blast wave from\na l-megaton explosion arriving about 22 seconds\nafter the warning light.

But the large majority ofcitizens\nwould not be injured by these early SLBM attacks.\nThese explosions would be life-saving \u0022take cover\u0022\nwarningsto most Americans, ifthey have been properly\ninformed.\nSudden powerand communicationsfailurescaused\nby the electromagnetic pulse (EMP) effects of nuclear\nexplosions also could serve as attack warnings in\nextensive areas. An EMP is an intense burst of radio-\nfrequency radiation generated by a nuclear explosion.\nThe strong, quick-rising surges of electric current\ninduced by EMP in power transmission lines and long\nantennas could burn out most unprotected electrical\nand electronic equipment. Alsolikelytobedamaged\nor destroyed would be unprotected computers.\nThe solid state electrical components of some\naircraft and of some motors of modern autos,\ntrucks, and tractors may be put out of commis-\nsion. Metalbodiesgivesomeprotection, whereas\nplastic bodies give little.\nThe usual means of protectingelectrical equipment\nagainst surges of current produced by lightning are\ngenerally ineffective against EM P. The protective\nmeasures are known, but to date all too few civilian\ninstallations have been protected against EMP effects.\nThree or four nuclear weapons skillfully spaced and\ndetonated at high altitudes over the United States\nwould produce EMPeffects that might knock out most\npublic power, most radioand TV broadcastingstations\nlacking special protection against these effects, and\nmost radios connected to long antennas. Nuclear\nexplosions on or near the ground may produce dam-\naging EMP effects over areas somewhat larger than\nthose in which such equipmentand buildings would be\ndamaged by the blast effects.\nHOW TO RESPOND TO UNEXPECTED\nATTACK WARNINGS\nAlthough a Pearl-Harbor-type of attack is\nunlikely; citizens should be prepared to respond\neffectively to unexpected warnings.\nThese warnings include:\n\u2022 Extremely bright lights-more light than has\nbeen seen before. The dazzling. bright lights of the\nfirst SLBM explosions on targets in many parts of the\nUnited States would beseen by most Americans. One\nshould not look to determine the source of light and\nheat, because there is danger of the viewer\u0027s eyes\nbeing damaged by the heat and light from a large\nexplosion at distances as far as a hundred miles away,\nin clear weather. Look down and away from the\nprobable source, and quickly get behind anything\nthat will shield you from most of the thermal pulse\u0027s\nburning heat and intense light. A thermal pulse\ndelivers its heat and light for several seconds-for\nmore than II seconds ifit isfrom a I-megaton surface\nburst and for approximately 44 seconds if from a 20-\nmegaton surface burst.\nIf you are at home when you see the amazingly\nbright light, run out of rooms with windows. Hurry\nto a windowless hallway or down into the basement.\nIf you have a shelterclose to your house, but separate\nfrom it, do not leave the best cover in your home to\nrun outdoors to reach the shelter; wait until about\ntwo minutes after first seeing the light.\nIf outdoors when you see the bright light, get\nbehind the best available cover.\nIt would be impossible to estimate the distance\nto an explosion from its light or appearance, so you\nshould stay under cover for about two minutes. A\nblast wave initially travels much faster than the\nnormal speed of sound (about 1 mile in 5 seconds).\nBut by the time its overpressure has decreased to I\npound per square inch (psi), a blast wave and its\nthunderous sound have slowed down and are moving\nonly about 3C/c faster than the normal speed of sound.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":31,"content":"If no blast or sound reaches you in two minutes,\nyou would know that the explosion was over 25miles\naway and you would not be hurt by blast effects,\nunless cut by shattered window glass. After two\nminutes you can safely leave the best cover in your\nhome and get a radio. Turn the dial to the stations to\nwhich you normally listen and try to find informa-\ntion. Meanwhile, quickly make preparations to go to\nthe best shelter you and your family can reach within\n15 minutes-the probable time interval before the\nfirst ICBMs start to explode.\nAt no time after an attack begins should you\nlook out of a window or stay near a window. Under\ncertain atmospheric conditions, windows can be\nshattered by a multimegaton explosion a hundred\nmiles away.\n\u2022 The sound of explosions. The thunderous\nbooms of the initial SLBM explosions would be\nheard over almost all parts of the United States.\nPersons one hundred miles away from a nuclear\nexplosion may receive their first warning by hearing\nit about 71 2 minutes later. Most would have time to\nreach nearby shelter before the ICBMs begin to\nexplode.\n\u2022 Loss of electric power and communications. If\nthe lights go out and you find that many radio and TV\nstations are suddenly off the air, continue to dial if\nyou have a battery-powered radio, and try to find a\nstation that is still broadcasting.\nHOW TO RESPOND TO ATTACK WARNINGS\nDURING A WORSENING CRISIS\nIfan attack takes place duringa worseningcrisis,\nthe effectiveness of warnings would be greater. Even\nif ovr government did not order an evacuation of\nhigh-risk areas, millions of Americans would already\nhave moved to safer areas if they had learned that the\nenemy\u0027s urban civilians were evacuating or that\ntactical nuclear weapons were being employed over-\nseas. Many prudent citizens would sleep inside the\nbest available shelter and stay in or near shelter most\nof their waking hours. Many people would have\nmade or improved family or small-groupsheltersand\nwould have supplied them with most essentials. The\nofficial warning systems would have been fully\nalerted and improved.\nDuring such a tense crisis period, neighbors\nor people sheltered near each other should have\nsomeone listen to radio stations at all times of the\nday and night. Ifthe situation worsened or an attack\nwarning were broadcast, the listener could alert the\nothers.\nOne disadvantage of waiting to build expedient\nshelters until there is a crisis is that many of the\nbuilders are likely to be outdoors improving their\nshelters when the first SLBMs are launched. The\nSLBM warheads may arrive so soon that the civilian\nwarning systems cannot respond in time. To reduce\nthe risk of being burned, persons working outdoors\nwhen expecting an attack should wear shirts, hats,\nand gloves. They shouldjump into a shelteror behind\na nearby shielding object at the first warning, which\nmay be the sudden cut-off of some radio\nbroadcasts.\nREMAINING INSIDE SHELTER\nCuriosity and ignorance probably will cause\nmany people to come out of sheltersa fewhours after\nan attack warning, if no blast or obvious fallout has\nendangered their area. This is dangerous, because\nseveral hours after almost all missiles have been\nlaunched the first enemy bombers may strike. Cities\nand other targets that have been spared because\nmissiles malfunctioned or missed are likely to be\ndestroyed by nuclear bombs dropped during the first\nseveral days after the first attack.\nMost people should stay inside their shelters for\nat least two or three days, even ifthey are in a locality\nfar from a probable target and even if fallout meter\nreadings prove there is no dangerous fallout.\u00B7\nExceptions would include some of the people who\nwould need to improve shelters or move to better\nshelters. Such persons could do so at relatively small\nrisk duringthe interval between the ICBM explosions\nand the arrival of enemy bombers and/or the start of\nfallout deposition a few hours later.\nFallout would cover most of the United States\nwithin 12 hours after a massive attack. People could\nrarely depend on information received from distant\nradio stations regarding changing fallout dangers and\nadvising when and for how long they could go outside\ntheir shelters. Weather conditions such as wind speed\nwould cause fallout dangers to vary with distance. If\nnot forced by thirst or hunger to leave shelter, they\nshould depend on thei.rown fallout meter readings or\non radiation measurements made by neighbors or local\ncivildefense workers.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":32,"content":"HOW TO KEEP RADIOS OPERATING\nHaving a radio to receive emergency broadcasts\nwould be a great advantage. The stations that would\nstill be on the air after an attack would probably be\ntoo distant from most survivors to give them reliable\ninformation concerning local, constantly changing\nfallout dangers. However, both morale and the\nprospects of long-range survival would be improved\nin shelters with a radio bringing word of the large-\narea fallout situation, food-relief measures, practical\nsurvival skills, and what the government and other\norganizations were doing to help. Radiocontact with\nthe outside world probably can be maintained after\nan attack if you remember to:\n\u2022 Bring all of your family\u0027s battery-powered,\nportable radios with you to shelter, along with all\nfresh batteries on hand.\n\u2022 Protect AM radios by using only their built-in\nshort loop antennas. The built-in antennas of small\nportable radios are too short for EMP to induce\ndamaging surges of current in them.\n\u2022 Keep antennas of FM, CB, and amateur radios\nas short as practical, preferably less than 10 inches.\nWhen threatened by EMP, a danger that may con-\ntinue for weeks after the initial attack because of\nrepeated, high-altitude explosions, do not add a wire\nantenna or connect a short radio antenna to a pipe.\nRemember that a surge of current resulting from\nEMP especially can damage diodes and transistors,\nthus ending a radio\u0027s usefulness or reducing its range\nof reception.\n\u2022 Keep all unshielded radios at least six feet away\nfrom any long piece of metal, such as pipes, metal\nducts, or wires found in many basements and other\nshelters. Long metal conductors can pick up and\ncarry large EMP surges, causing induced current\nto surge in nearby radios and damage them.\n\u2022 Shield each radio against EMP when not in use\nby completely surrounding it with conducting metal\nifit is kept within six feet ofa long conductorthrough\nwhich powerful currents produced by EMP might\nsurge. A radio may be shielded against EMP by\nplacing it inside a metal cake box or metal storage\ncan, or by completely surrounding it with aluminum\nfoil or metallic window screen.\n\u2022 Disconnect the antenna cable of your car radio\nat the receiver-or at least ground the antenna when\nnot in use by connecting it with a wire to the car\nframe. Use tape or clothespins to assure good metal-\nto-metal contact. The metal of an outside mirror is\na convenient grounding-point. Park your car as near\nto your shelter as practical, so that after fallout\nhas decayed sufficiently you may be able to use\nthe car radio to get distant stations that are still\nbroadcasting.\n\u2022 Prevent possible damage to a radio from ex-\ntreme dampness (which may result from long\noccupancy of some belowground shelters) by keep-\ning it sealed in a clear plastic bag large enough so\nthe radio can be operated while inside. An additional\nprecaution is to keep a plastic-covered radio in an\nair-tight. container with some anhydrite made from\nwallboard gypsum, as described in Appendix C.\n\u2022 Conserve batteries, because after an attack you\nmay not be able to get replacements for months.\nListen only periodically, to the stations you find give\nthe most useful information. The batteries of\ntransistor radios will last up to twice as long if the\nradios are played at reduced volume.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":33,"content":"Chapter 4\nEvacuation\nCHANGED EVACUATION REQUIREMENTS\nThe most threatening Soviet nuclear war-\nheads in the mid-1970s were multi-megaton,\nsuch as single warheads of approximately 20\nmegatons carried by each of over 250 SS-18s.\nAbout half of these huge Russian warheads\nwould have hit within a quarterof a mile orless\nof their intended targets - close enough to\ndestroy a missile in its hardened silo. Today\u0027s\nimproved Russian warheadshave a 50-50 proba-\nbility of hittingwithin a few hundredfeetof their\naiming points. With such accuracy, multi-\nmegaton warheads are not needed to destroy\nvery hard targets, especially missiles in their\nblast-protective silos.\nSoviet strategy continues to stress the de-\nstruction of military targets, in order to mini-\nmize Russian losses from retaliatory strikes.\nThis logical, long-establishedSovietstrategy is\nemphasized in numerous authoritative Russian\nbooks, including the three editions of Soviet\nMilitary Strategy, by Marshall ofthe Soviet Union\nV. D: Sokolovskiy.\nOne result of this logical strategy has been\nthe replacement of huge Soviet warheads by\nnumerous, much smaller, much more accurate\nwarheads. In 1990 almost all large missiles\nhave several Multiple Independently-targetted\nReentry Vehicles (MIRVed) warheads. Soviet\nwarheads - especially the 10 warheads of\n500 kilotons each carried by most SS-18s -\ncould destroy almost all important U.S. fixed\nmilitary installations, and also almost all U.S.\ncommandandcontrolfacilities, airportrunways\nlonger than 7,000 feet, major seaports, and the\nfactories and refineries that are the basis of our\nmilitary power. (Although an all-out Soviet\nattack could destroy almost all missile silos\nand missiles in them, a first-strike attack is\ndeterred in partbythe possibilitythat mostU.S.\nmissiles in silos would be launched on warning\nand would be in space, on their trajectories\ntoward Russian targets, beforeSovietwarheads\ncould reach their silos.)\nHow should your plans either to evacuate\nduring a worsening crisis, or to remain in your\nhome area, be influenced by the dramatic\nchanges inthe Soviet nuclear arsenal? Some of\nthese changes are indicated by Fig. 4.1, that\nincorporates information on the dimensions of\nthe stabilized clouds of one megaton and 200\n,kiloton explosions, from reference 6, The Effects\nofNuclear Weapons, 1977,and similarinformation\non a 20-megaton cloud derived from a graph on\npage 20 of The Effects on the Atmosphere ofa Major\nNuclear Exchange, by the Committee on the At-\nmospheric Effects of Nuclear Explosions, Na-\ntional Research Council, National Academy\nPress, Washington, D.C. 1985. (This NRC graph\nis based on Ballistic Missile Organization 83-5\nPart 1, datedzs September 1983, a report that is\nnot generally available.)\nThe air bursting of one of the probably few\n20-megaton warheads carried by Soviet ICBMs\nwould destroy typical American homes up to\nabout 16milesfrom groundzero. Incontrast, the\nair bursting of an approximately t-megaton\nwarhead - one ofthe large warheads in today\u0027s\nSoviet arsenal - would destroy most homes\nwithin a roughly circular area having a radius\nof \u0022only\u0022 about 5 miles. So, if you take into\nconsideration the advantages to Soviets of\narming their largest ICBMs with several very\naccurate smaller warheads, each capable of\ndestroying a militarily important target, you\nmay logically conclude that unless your home\nis closerthan 10miles from the nearestprobable\ntarget, you need not evacuate to avoid blast and\nfire dangers.\nYour planning to avoid incapacitating or\nfatal exposure to fallout radiation will involve\nmore uncertaintiesthan will yourplansto avoid\nblast and fire dangers.

Its tremendous\nfireball would \u0022suck up\u0022 millions of tons of\npulverized rock and would contaminate those\nparticles with its radioactive material. Fallout\nparticles as big as marbles\u0022 would fall from the\nstabilized cloud to the ground in minutes.

Furthermore. survivors would have to\nremain inside shelters for most of each day for several\nadditional weeks.\nThe radiation dangers in the shaded areas of the\nmap are shown decreasing as the distances from the\nexplosions increase.

Furthermore, this\ncomputer-drawn map made at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory does not indicate the very dangerous\n29\nfallout near the isolated surface bursts. Although the\nmost dangerous fallout would be carried by high-\naltitude winds that usually blow from westto east, such\nsimplified fallout patterns as those shown should be\nused only as rough guides to help improve chances of\nevacuating a probable blast area or very heavy fallout\narea and going to a less dangerous area. Wind\ndirections are undependable; an enemy\u0027s targeting can\nbe unexpected; weapons can miss. A prudent citizen.\nno matter where he is,should try to build a shelter that\ngives excellent protection against fallout radiation.\nA major disadvantage of all types of risk-area\nmaps is the fact that poorly informed people often\nmisinterpret them and conclude that ifthey are outside\na mapped risk area, they are relatively safe from blast,\nfire, and even deadly fallout dangers.\nAnother reason for not placing much re-\nliance on risk-area maps like Fig. 4.2 is that\nsuch unclassified maps available in 1986 are\nbased onthe largestattacks consideredpossible\na decade ago. In 1986the sizesofSovietwarheads\nare much smaller, their numbers are much\nlarger, and their total megatonage and capa-\nbility to produce fallout remain about the same\nas 10 years ago.\nThe outdated attack scenario used in pro-\nducing Fig. 4.2 also involved the surface burst-\ning of multi-megaton warheads totaling 3,190\nmegatons on military targets, including over\n2,000 megatons logically surfacebursted on our\nfive Minuteman missile fields. Such an attack\non our missile fields would produce about the\nsame amount of fallout as is shown in Fig. 4.2.\nToday, however, heavy fallout from ourmissile\nfields would extend somewhatshorterdistances\ndownwind, because of the lower heights of the\nstabilized radioactive clouds from one-megaton\nand smaller surface and near-surface bursts, as\ncompared to those of multi-megaton warheads\nthat would have been exploded 10 years ago, at a\ntime when a 20-megaton warhead was typical of\nthe Soviet nuclear ICBM arsenal.\nIn 1986 hundreds of targets besides those\nindicated in Fig. 4.2 might be hit, but the total\narea ofthe United States subjectedto lethal fall-\nout probably would be lessthan is shown in Fig.\n4.2. To maximize areas of destruction by blast\nand fire, mosttargets in urban and/or industrial\nareas would be attacked with air bursts, which\nwould produce little or no promptly lethal or\nincapacitatingfallout - exceptperhaps in scat-\ntered \u0022hot spots\u0022 where rain-outs or snow-outs\ncould bring huge numbers of tiny, very radio-\nactive particles to earth within hours after the\nair burstingoftoday\u0027skiloton-range Sovietwar-\nheads.

However,\nthis beliefisdependent on two conditions: (I) that ina\ndesperate, worsening crisis our country\u0027s highest\nofficials would supply strong, motivating leadership;\nand (2) that Americans would have received-well in\nadvance-shelter-building and otherpractical, tested\nsurvival instructions.\nSHELTER AGAINST RADIAnON\nThe family previously pictured evacuatingbycar\n(Fig. 4.3) drove 64 miles to build a shelter at the site\nshown in Fig. 5.1. Although the August sun was very\nhot in this irrigated Utah valley, the family members\ndid not build in the shade of nearby trees. To avoid\ndigging through roots, they carried the poles about\n150 feet and dug their trench near the edge of the\ncornfield.\nThe father and the oldest son did most of the\nwork of making the shelter. The mother and second\nson had health problems; the two youngest children\nwere not accustomed to work.\nThe family followed an earlier version of the\nplans and instructions given in Appendix A for\nbuilding a Pole-Covered Trench Shelter. Because the\nearth was firm and stable, the trenches were dugwith\nvertical walls. If the earth had been less stable, it\nwould have been necessary to slope the walls-\nincreasing the width at the top of the main trench\nfrom 3\\/2 to 5 feet.\nBefore placing the roof poles, the workers\nassured themselves a more comfortable shelter by\ncovering the trench walls. They had brought a large\nnumber of the plastic garbage bags required in their\nhome community and split some bags open to make\nwall coverings. Bed sheets or other cloth could have\nbeen used.\nThe room of this 6-person shelter was 31/2 feet\nwide, 41/2 feet high, and 161/2 feet long. A small stand-\nup hole was dug at one end, so each tall occupant\ncould stand up and stretch several times a day.\nThe trenches for entry and emergency exit were\ndug only 22 inches wide, to minimize radiation\nentering the shelter through these openings. One wall\nof these two narrow trenches was an extension of the\nFig. 5.1.

The family\nsat and slept along the left wall, to be better shielded\nfrom radiation coming through the openings.\nThis shelter was designed so that its main trench\ncould be enlarged to make a much more livable room\nwithout disturbing its completed roof. For this\nreason, the 9-foot roofing poles were placed off-\ncenter, with the two extra feet resting on the ground\nto the right of the main room.\nWhenever practical, expedient shelters should\nbe built so that they can be readily enlarged to make\nsemi-permanent livingquarters. Afterit becomessafe\nto emerge for limited periods, occupants could sleep\nand spend much of their waking time in such a\nrainproof dugout that affords excellent protection\nagainst continuing radiation. In cold weather, living\nin a dugout like this is more comfortable than living\nin a tent or shack. Afterthe fallout radiation dose rate\noutdoors has decayed to lessthan about 2R per hour,\nthe small vertical entry could be enlarged arid\nconverted to a steeply inclined stairway.\nThe importance of giving inexperienced shelter\nbuilders detailed instructions is illustrated by the\nunnecessary work done by the young women shown\nin Fig. 5.2. They had agreed to try to build a Pole-\nCovered Trench. Shelter, working unassisted and\nusing only hand tools. Because the summer sun in\nUtah was hot, they selected a shady site under a large\ntree. The briefinstructions they received included no\nadvice on the selection of a building site. Cuttingand\ndigging out the numerous roots was very difficult for\nthem and required several of the 22 hours they spent\nactually working.\nAnother disadvantage of making a shelterunder\ntrees is that more of the gamma rays from fallout\nparticles on the leaves and branches would reach and\npenetrate the shelter than if these same particles were\non the ground. Many gamma rays from fallout\nparticles on the ground would be scattered or\nabsorbed by striking rocks, clods of earth, tree\ntrunks, or houses before reaching a belowground\nshelter.\nFig. 5.2.

The 3-foot thickness of earth\nshown (or a 2-foot thickness ofconcrete) willprovide\nan effective barrier, attenuating (absorbing) about\n99.9% of all gamma rays from fallout.

The man\u0027s\nexposed head, which is just below ground level,\nwould be hit byabout one-tenthas manygamma rays\nas if it were 3feet above ground (Fig. 5.3).

For good protection he must be protected\noverhead and on all sides by barrier shielding.\nThe barrier shielding of the Pole-Covered\nTrench Shelter shown in Fig. 5.4 was increased by\nshoveling additional earth onto its \u0022buried roof.\u0022\nAfter father and son had mounded earth about 18\ninches deep over the centerline of the roof poles, a\nlarge piece of 4-mil-thick polyethylene was placed\nover the mound.

A right-angle turn, either from a\nvertical or horizontal entry, causes a reduction of\nabout 90%.\nNote: Fallout shelters need not provideadditional\nshielding to protect occupants against initial nuclear\nradiation that is emitted from the fireballs of nuclear\nexplosions.

This arch carries the load to\nsurrounding supports that are less yielding. These\nsupports often include adjacent earth that has not\nbeen disturbed.\nTo attain earth arching, the earth covering the\nyielding roofmust be at least as deep as half the width\nof the roof between its supports. Then the resultant\nearth arch above the roof carries most of the load.\n(A familiar example of effective earth arching is\nits use with sheet metal culverts under roads. The\narching in a few feet of earth over a thin-walled\nculvert prevents it from being crushed by the weight\nof heavy vehicles.)\nFigure 5.7shows how a flexible roofyields under\nthe weight of 30 inches ofearth mounded over it and\nhow earth arching develops.

These\nradiations would be minor dangers to informed\npeople in fallout areas, especially to those who had\nentered almost any kind ofshelter before the fallout\nbegan to be deposited in their area.\n\u2022 Beta particles are high-speed electrons given off\nby some of the radioactive atoms in fallout. Only the\nhighest-energy beta particlescan penetrate more than\nabout 10feet ofairor about I/Xinch of water, wood, or\nhuman body tissue. Any building that keeps out\nfallout particles will prevent injury from beta radia-\ntion.\nThe only frequently serious dangers are from (I)\ninternal beta-radiation doses from fallout-\ncontaminated food or drink, and (2) beta burns from\nfresh fallout particles. Fresh fallout particles are no\nmore than a few days old and therefore very\nradioactive. If fresh particles remain: for at least\nseveral tens of minutes in contact with the skin, beta\nburns are likely to result. If only thin clothing\nseparates fresh fallout particles from the skin, a\nconsiderably longer time will elapse before their\nradiation causes beta burns.\nIn dry, windy weather, fresh fallout particles\nmight get inside one\u0027s nose and ears, along with dust\nand sand, and could cause beta burns ifnot promptly\nwashed off or otherwise removed.\nPrompt washing will prevent beta burns. If\nwater .is not available, brushing and rubbing the\nfallout particles off the skin will help.\nIf a person is exposed outdoors where there is\nheavy, fresh fallout for a long enough time to receive\u0027\na large dose of gamma radiation, the highest-energy\nbeta radiation given off by fresh fallout particles on\nthe ground may be a relatively minor danger to his\neyes and skin. Even ordinary glasses give good\nprotection to the eyes against such beta radiation,\nand ordinary clothing gives good protection to the\nskin.\nOrdinary clothing will shield and protect the\nbody quite well from all but the highest-energy beta\nparticles given off by fresh fallout deposited on the\nclothing. Fallout-contaminated clothing should be\nremoved as soon as practical, or at least brushed and\nbeaten before entering a shelter room, to rid it of as\nmany fallout particles as possible. (Fallout particles\nthat are many days old will not cause beta burns\nunless large quantities are on the body for hours.)\nMost of the knowledge about beta burns on\nhuman skin was gathered as a result of an accident\nduring the largest U.S. H-bomb test in the tropical\nPacific.\u0022 Winds blew the fallout in a direction not\nanticipated by the meteorologists. Five hours after\nthe multimegaton surface burst, some natives of the\nMarshall Islands noticed a white powder beginning\nto be deposited on everything exposed, including\ntheir bare, moist skin. Unknown to them, the very\nsmall particles were fresh fallout. (Most fallout is\nsand-like, but fallout from bursts that have cratered\ncalcareous rock, such as coral reefs and limestone, is\npowdery or flakey, and white.) Since the natives knew\nnothing about fallout, they thought the white dust\nwas ashes from a distant volcanic eruption. For two\ndays, until they were removed from their island\nhomes and cared for by doctors, they paid practically\nno attention to the white dust. Living inthe open and\nin lightly constructed homes, they received from the\nfallout all around them a calculated gamma-ray dose\nofabout 175 R in the two days they were exposed.\nThe children played in the fallout-contaminated\nsand. The fallout on these islanders\u0027 scalps, bare\nnecks, and the tops of their bare feet caused itching\nand burning sensations after a time. Days later, beta\nburns resulted, along with extreme discoloration of\nthe skin. Beta burns are not deep burns; however, it\ntook weeks to heal them. Some, in spite of proper\nmedical attention, developed into ulcers. (No serious\npermanent skin injury resulted, however.)\nFor survivors confined inside crowded,\nunsanitary shelters by heavy fallout, and without\nmedicines, beta burns could be a worse problemthan\nwere similar burns to the Marshall Islanders.\nAll of the Marshall Islanders unknowingly ate\nfallout-contaminated food and drank fallout-\ncontaminated water for two days. Mainly as a result\nof this, radioactive iodine was concentrated in their\nthyroid glands, and thyroid abnormalities developed\nyears later. (There isa simple, very low-cost means of\nattaining almost complete protection against this\ndelayed hazard: taking minute prophylactic doses of\na salt, potassium iodide. This will be discussed in\nChapter 13.)\nIn dry, dusty, windy areas the human nasal\npassages usually filter out much dust. A large part of\nit is swallowed and may be hazardous if the dust is\ncontaminated with fallout. Under such dry, windy\nconditions, beta burns also could be caused by large\namounts of dust lodged inside the nasal passages.\nBreathing through a dust mask, towel, or other cloth","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":50,"content":"would give good protection against this localized\nhazard. In conclusion: persons under nuclear attack\nshould make considerable effort to protect them-\nselves from beta radiation.\n\u2022 Alpha particles, identical to the nuclei ofhelium\natoms, are given off by some of the radioactiveatoms\nin fallout. These particles have very little penetrating\npower: 1 to 3 inches of air will stop them. It is\ndoubtful that alpha particles can get through\nunbroken skin; they cannot penetrate even a thin\nfabric.\u0027 Alpha particles are hazardous only if\nmaterials that emit them (such as the radioactive\nelement plutonium) enter the body and are retained\nin bone, lung tissue, or other parts of the body. Any\nshelter that excludes fallout .particles affords\nexcellent protection against this radiation danger.\nUnless survivors eat or drink fallout-contaminated\nfood or water in considerably larger quantities than\ndid the completely uninformed natives of the\nMarshall Islands, danger from alpha particles would\nbe minor.\nPROTECTION AGAINST OTHER NUCLEAR\nWEAPONS EFFECTS\n\u2022 Flash burns are caused by the intense rays of\nheat emitted from the fireball within the first minute\nfollowing an explosion.\u0022 This thermal radiation\ntravels at the speed of light and starts to heat or burn\nexposed people and materials before the arrival ofthe\nblast wave. Thermal radiation is reduced-but not\neliminated-ifit passes through rain, dense clouds, or\nthick smoke. On a clear day, serious flash burns on a\nperson\u0027s exposed skin can be caused bya 20-megaton\nexplosion that is 25 miles away.\nA covering of clothing-preferably of white\ncloth that reflects light-can reduce or prevent flash\nburns on those who are in a large part of an area in\nwhich thermal radiation is a hazard. However, in\nareas close enough to ground zero for severe blast\ndamage, the clothing of exposed people could be set\non fire and their bodies badly burned.\n\u2022 Fires ignited by thermal radiation and those\nresulting from blast and other causes especially\nwould endanger people pinned down by fallout while\nin or near flammable buildings. Protective measures\nagainst the multiple dangers from fire, carbon mon-\noxide, and toxic smokes are discussed in Chapter 7.\n\u2022 Flash blindness can be caused by the intense\nlight from an explosion tens of miles away in clear\nweather. Although very disturbing, the blindness is\nnot permanent; most victims recover within seconds\nto minutes. Among the Hiroshima and Nagasaki\nsurvivors (people who had been in the open more\nthan persons expecting a nuclear attack would be),\nthere were a number of instances of temporary\nblindness that lasted as long as 2 or 3 hours, but only\none case of permanent retinal injury was reported.\u0022\nFlash blindness may be produced by scattered\nlight; the victim of this temporary affliction usually\nhas not looked directlyat the fireball. Flash blindness\nwould be more severe at night, when the pupils are\nlarger. Retinal burns, a permanent injury, can result\nat great distances if the eye is focused on the fireball.\nPeople inside any shelter with no openings\nthrough which light can shine directly would be\nprotected from flash burns and eye damage. Persons\nin the open with adequate warning of a nuclear\nexplosion can protect themselves from both flash\nblindness and retinal burns by closing or shielding\ntheir eyes. They should get behind anything casting a\nshadow- quickly.\nSKIN BURNS FROM HEATED DUST\n(THE POPCORNING EFFECT)\nWhen exposed grains of sand and particles of\nearth are heated very rapidly by intense thermal\nradiation, they explode like popcorn and pop up into\nthe air.\u0022 While this dust is airborne, the continuing\nthermal radiation heats it to temperatures that may\nbe as high as several thousand degrees Fahrenheit on\na clear day in areas of severe blast. Then the shock\nwave and blast winds arrive and can carry the\nburning-hot air and dust into an open shelter.6.9\nAnimals inside open shelters have been singed and\nseriously burned in some of the nuclearair-burst tests\nin Nevada.\u0022\nThus Japanese working inside an open tunnel-\nshelter at Nagasaki within about 100yards ofground\nzero were burned on the portion oftheir skin that was\nexposed to the entering blast wind, even though they\nwere protected by one or two turns in the tunnel.4\n(None of these Japanese workers who survived the\nblast-wave effects had fatal burns or suffered serious\nradiation injuries, which they certainly would have\nsuffered had they been outside and subjected to the\nthermal pulse and the intense initial nuclear radiation\nfrom the fireball.)\nExperiments conducted during several nuclear\ntest explosions have established the amount of\nthermal radiation that must be delivered to exposed\nearth to produce the popcorning effect.\u0022 Large air\nbursts may result inexposed skin beingburned by hot","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":51,"content":"dust and heated air produced at overpressure ranges\nas low as 3 or 4 psi. However, calculations indicate\nthat the large surface bursts most likely to endanger\nAmericans would not result in the occupants ofsmall,\nopen shelters being burned by these effects-i-except\nat somewhat higher overpressures.\nProtection is simple against the heated dust and\nvery hot airthat may be blown into an openshelterby\nthe blast. When expecting an attack, occupants of an\nopen shelter should keep towels or other cloths in\nhand. When they see the bright light from an explo-\nsion, they should cover their heads and exposed skin.\nIf time and materials are available, much better\nprotection is given by making expedient blast doors,\nas described in Appendix D. When occupants seethe\nvery bright light from a large explosion miles away,\nthey can close and secure such doors before the\narrival of the blast wave several seconds later.\nESSENTIAL LIFE-SUPPORT EQUIPMENT\nShelters can be built to give excellent protection\nagainst all nuclear weapon effects, except in places\nwithin or very close to cratered areas. But most\nshelters would be of little use inareas of heavy fallout\nunless supplied with enough life-support equipment\nto enable occupants to stay inthe shelters until condi-\ntions outside become endurable. In heavy fallout\nareas most high-protection-factor shelters would be\ncrowded; except in cold weather, most would need a\nventilating pump to remove warmed air and bring in\nenough cooler outdoor air to maintain survivable\ntemperature-humidity conditions. Means for storing\nadequate water is another essential life-support\nrequirement. These and other essential or highly\ndesirable life-support needs are covered in following\nchapters.\nBASEMENT SHELTERS\nThe blast and fire effects of a massive, all-out\nattack of the magnitude possible in 1987 would\ndestroy or damage most American homes and\nother buildings and endanger the occupants of\nshelters inside them. Outside the blast and/or\nfire areas, the use of shelters inside buildings\nwould not be nearly as hazardous. However, an\nenemy might also target some areas into which\nlarge numbers of urbanAmericans hadevacua-\nted before the attack, although such targetting\nis notbelievedto be included inSovietstrategy.\nEarth-covered expedient shelters in a blast area\ngive better protection against injury from blast, fire,\nor fallout than do almost all basements. But during\nthe more likely kinds of crises threatening nuclear\nwar most urban Americans, including those who\nwould evacuate into areas outside probable blast\nareas, probably would lack the tools, materials,\nspace, determination, physical strength, or time\nrequired to build good expedient shelters that are\nseparate from buildings and covered with earth. As a\nresult, most unprepared urban citizens would have to\nuse basements and other shelters in existing\nstructures, for want of better protection.\nShelters in buildings, including basement shelters,\nhave essentially the same requirements as expedient\nshelters: adequate shielding against fallout radiation,\nstrength, adequate ventilation-cooling, water, fallout\nradiation meters, food, hygiene,etc.Sketches and short\ndescriptions of ways to improve the fallout protection\nafforded by home basements are to befound in widely\ndistributed civil defense pamphlets, including two\nentitled \u0022In Time of Emergency,\u0022 and \u0022Protection in\nthe Nulear Age.\u0022 In 1987, millions of copies of\nthese pamphlets are stockpiled for possible\ndistributionduringa crisis.Unfortunately, most\nof such official instructions were written years\nago, whenthedeliverable megatonnage andthe\nnumberof Sovietwarheadswere smallfractions\nof what they are today. Official civil defense\ninstructions now available to average Ameri-\ncans do not inform the reader as to what degree of\nprotection against fallout radiation (what protection\nfactor) isgiven by the differenttypes of do-it-yourself\nshelters pictured. There is no mention of dependable\nways to provide adequate cooling-ventilation, an\nessential requirement ifeven a home basementisto be\noccupied by several families in warm or hot weather.\nOutdated or inadequate information is given about\nwater, food, the improvement of shelter in one\u0027s\nhome, and other survival essentials.\nNo field-tested instructions at present are\navailable to guide householders who may want to\nstrengthen the floor over a home basement so that it\ncan safely support 2feet of shieldingearth piled on it.\nIn areas of heavy fallout, such strengthening- often\nwould be needed to safely support adequate overhead\nshielding, especially ifthe house were to bejarredby a\nlight shock from a distant explosion. In the following\nparagraphs, a way to greatly improve the fallout\nprotection afforded by a typical home basement is\noutlined. If improved in this manner, a basement\nwould provide excellent fallout protectionfor several\nfamilies.\nFirst, earth should be placed on the floor above\nto a depth of about one foot. Earth can be carried\nefficiently by using sacks or pillowcases, using the\ntechniques described in Chapter 8for carryingwater.\nIf earth is not available because the ground isfrozen","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":52,"content":"or because of the lack of digging tools, other heavy\nmaterials (containers of water, heavy furniture,\nbooks, etc.) should be placed on the floor above.\nThese materials should weigh enough to produce a\nloading of about 90 pounds per square foot-about\nthe same weight as earth one foot thick. This initial\nloading of the floor joists causes them to carry some\nof the weight that otherwise would be supported by\nthe posts that then are to be installed.\nNext, a horizontal beam is installed so as to\nsupport all of the floor joists under their centers.\nFigure 5.8 shows a beam and one of its supporting\nposts. Such a supporting beam preferably is made by\nnailing three 2X6s securely together.

Iftrees at\nleast 4 inches in diameter are not available, make\nposts by nailing boards together. Position the two\noutermost posts within 2 feet of the ends of the beam.\nSpace the posts at even intervals, with each post\nunder a floor joist. A post under every third joist is\nideal; this usually means a spacing between posts of\nabout 41(2 feet. Ifthe basement is20 feet long, 5 posts\nare enough. Nail each post to the beam, and secure\nthe bases of each with brace boards laid on the\nbasement floor, as illustrated.\nFinally, place a second l-foot-thick layer of\nearth on the floor above. Ifthe basement windowsare\nprotected with boards and if all but a part of one\nwindow and all the aboveground parts of the\nbasement walls are covered with earth 2feet thick, the\nbasement shelter will have a protection factor of\nseveral hundred against fallout radiation.\nAdequate ventilation and cooling should be\nassured by using a homemade air pump (a KAP),\nmade and installed as described in Appendix B.\nForced ventilation is especially necessary if more\nthan one family occupies the basement in warm or\nhot weather.\nMore work and materials are. required to\nimprove a home basement in this manner than are\nneeded -to build a covered-trench shelter for one\nfamily. An earth-covered shelter separate from\nbuildings will provide equally good protection\nagainst radiation, better protectionagainst blast, and\nmuch better protection against fire.\nIf a family cannot build a separate, earth-\ncovered shelter outdoors, often it would be advisable\nto make a very small shelter in the most protected\ncorner of the basement. Such an indoor shelter\nshould be of situp height (about 40 inches for tall\npeople) and no wider than 3 feet. Its walls can readily\nbe built of chairs, benches, boxes, and bureau\ndrawers. Interior doors make an adequately strong\nroof. Expedient shielding materials, to be placed on\nthe roof and the two exposed sides, can be ordinary\nwater containers and bureau drawers, boxes, and\npillow cases filled with earth orotherheavy materials.\nOr, if heavy-duty plastic trash bags or 4-mil\npolyethylene film are available, make expedient\nwater containers and use them for shielding. To do\nso, first line bureau drawers, boxes, pillow cases,\ntrash cans, etc. with plastic. Place the lined containers\nin position to shield your shelter, then fill these\nexpedient water containers with drinkable water (see\nChapter 8).\nAs demonstrated by hot-weather occupancy\ntests of such very small indoor shelters, a small KAP\nor other air pump must be operated to maintain a\nforced flow of air through such a crowded shelter, to\nprevent intolerable temperature-humidity\nconditions. (See Chapter 6 for ventilation-cooling\nrequirements, including the provision of an\nadequately large opening in each end of a shelter.) In\nsome basements a second small KAP would be\nneeded in hot weather to pump outdoor air through\nthe basement. This KAPcould be operated by pulling","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":53,"content":"a cord from within the small shelter, using an\nimprovised \u0022pulley\u0022 as described in Appendix B.\nPUBLIC SHELTERS\nIn the event of an unexpected attack, many\nunprepared Americans should and would take refuge\nin nearby marked public shelters. Throughout the\npopulated areas that would not be subjected to blast,\nfire. or heavy fallout, the use of public shelters could\nsave millions of lives. All persons concerned with\nsurvival should remember that the large majority of\nofficially surveyed and marked shelters give better\nprotection against radiation than most unimproved\nhome basements..\nPersons preparingto go to publicshelters should\nbe aware that many lack forced ventilation and that\nthe blowers and fans of most forced ventilation\nsystems would be stopped by loss of electric power\ndue to electromagnetic pulse effects or by other\neffects of nuclear explosions on electrical systems. A\nblast wave at an overpressure range as low as I psi\n(144 pounds per square foot) would wreck most\nshelter-ventilating fans. In 1987, no water or food\nnormally is stocked. A person who brought to a\npublic shelter 10large plastic trash bags and 10pillow\nslips, to make 10 expedient water bags in which 60\ngallons of water could be stored (as described in\nChapter 8), would help both himself and dozens of\nother shelter occupants. If he hoped to share the\nbasement in a strange family\u0027s home, his chances of\nbeing welcomed would be improved if he brought a\nsmall homemade shelter-ventilating pump and other\nsurvival items. The same small pump would be\nimpractical in a large public shelter. An Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory study completed in 1978found\nthat if all citizens were to go to National Shelter\nSurvey (:\\\u002755) shelters within one mile of their homes,\n69CC of those who found space would be in shelters\nrated for 1000 or more occupants.\u0027? The average\nnumber of shelter spaces in this largestclass of public\nshelters was 3179. The prospect of living in an\nunequipped shelter crowded with this many\nunprepared people-each of whom would have only\n10square feet of floor space--is a strong motivation\nto work hard to build and equip a small, earth-\ncovered shelter.\nDECIDING WHAT KIND OF SHELTER\nTO BUILD OR USE\nBefore deciding what kind of shelter you and\nyour family should build or use, it isbest to read all of\nthis book. Your final decision should include\nconsideration of ways to provide life-support\nequipment discussed in following chapters. At this\nstage, however, the reader will find it helpful to\nreview important reasons why different types of\nshelters offer the best hope of survival to different\npeople, in different areas, and under different\nconditions.\nThis book is written primarily to improve the\nsurvival chances of people who cannot or do not\nbuild permanent shelters. The information which\nfollows will help you select the best expedient or\navailable shelter for your family.\nSHELTER NEAR OR IN YOUR HOME\nIf your \u0027home is 10 or more miles from an\naverage target such as a major airport with long\nrunways, or is20or more miles from a great city with\nseveral strategic targets, you are fortunate: you can\nprudently build or use a shelter close to home. No\none can foretell accurately which way the winds will\nblow or where weapons will explode, so, if practical,\nyou should build a shelterthat gives better protection\nagainst fallout, blast, and fire than shelters in build-\nings. Most people living outside targeted areas could\nbuild such a shelter in two days or less, using one of\nthe designs of earth-covered expedient shelters\ndetailed in Appendix A.\nEven if you plan to evacuate, you should decide\nwhere you would take shelternearby incase you were\nunable to do so. There is always a chance that an\nattack may be launched without warning, giving\ninsufficient time to evacuate. Or the missile aimed at\nthe area in which you live may miss its target. If your\ntargeted home area were not hit, moderately heavy\nfallout might be the only danger; even an improved\nbasement shelter would be adequate in that case.\nEARTH-COVERED EXPEDIENT\nFAMILY SHELTERS\nAdvantages of earth-covered, expedient family\nshelters:\n\u2022 Better protection against heavy fallout, blast,\nand fire than afforded by the great majority of\nshelters in buildings.\n\u2022 The possibility of building in favorable\nlocations, including places far removed from target\nareas, and places where it is impractical to build or to\nimprove large group-shelters giving good protection.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":54,"content":"\u2022 The opportunity for men, women, and\nchildren to work together to providegood protection\nin minimum time.\n\u2022 A better chance to benefit from thoughtful\npreparations made in advance than would be the case\nin public shelters where water, food, etc. must be\nshared.\n\u2022 Less risk of personality clashes, hysteria under\nstress, exposure to infectious diseases, and other\nproblems that arise when strangers are crowded\ntogether for days or weeks.\nDisadvantages of earth-covered, expedient\nshelters:\n\u2022 It may be difficult to meet the requirementfor\ntime, space, people able to work hard, materials, and\ntools-and to get all these together at the building\nsite.\n\u2022 Building is difficult if heavy rain or snow is.\nfalling or if the ground is deeply frozen.

Unless most of the occupants\u0027 body\nheat and water vapor from sweat are removed by\nair circulated through a typical shelter. the heat-\nhumidity conditions will become increasingly dan-\n.gerous in warm or hot weather. One of the most\nimportant nuclear war survival skills people should\nlearn is how to keep occupied shelters adequately\nventilated in all seasons and cool enough for many\ndays of occupancy in warm or hot weather. Methods\nfor ventilating with homemade devices and for\nkeeping ventilating air from carrying fallout\nparticles into shelters are described in Appen-\ndices A and B. Instructions for Directional\nFanning, the simplest means for forcing ade-\nquate volumes of air to flow through shelters,\nare given at the end of this chapter.\nMAKING AND USING AN EXPEDIENT\nAIR PUMP\nThe best expedient way to maintain livable\nconditions in a shelter, especially in hot weather, isto\nmake and use a large-volume shelter-ventilating\npump. Field tests have proved that average Ameri-\ncans can build the expedient air pump described in\nAppendix B in a few hours, with inexpensive\nmaterials found in most households.\nThis simple pump was invented in 1962 by the\nauthor. I called it a Punkah-Pump, because its hand-\npulled operation is somewhat like that of an ancient\nfan called a \u0022punkah\u0022, still used by some primitive\npeoples in hot countries. (Unlike the punkah,\nhowever, this air pump can force air to move in a\ndesired direction and is a true purnp.) It was named\nthe Kearny Air Pump (KAP) by the Office of Civil\nDefense following tests of various models by\nStanford Research Institute, the Protective Struc-\ntures Development Center, and General American\nTransportation Company. These tests confirmed\nfindings first made at Oak Ridge National Labora-\ntory regarding the advantages of the KAP both as a\nmanually operated pump for forcing large volumes of\noutdoor air through shelters and as a device for\ndistributing air within shelters and fanning the\noccupants. See Fig. 6.1.\nThe air pump instructions given in Appendix B\nare the result of having scores offamilies and pairs of\nuntrained individuals, including children, build and\nuse this air pump. They were guided by successively\nimproved versions of these detailed, written instruc-\ntions, that include many illustrations (see Appendix\nB). Some people who are experienced at building\nthings will find these instructions unnecessarily long\nand detailed. However, shelter-building experiments\nhave shown that the physically stronger individuals,\nusually the more experienced builders, should do\nmore of the hard, manual work when shelters are\nbuilt, and that those less experienced at building\nshould do the lighter work-including making\nshelter-ventilating pumps.

Whileworking injunglesfrom the Amazon\nto Burma, I observed the methods used by the natives\nto avoid unhealthful conditions like those experienced\nin the Navy shelter, which was ventilated in a conven-\ntional American manner. Thesejungle methods include\nthe first five of the six cooling methods listed in this\nsection. During 24 years of civil defense research, my\ncolleagues and I have improved upon the cooling\nmethods of jungle people, primarily by the invention\nand thorough field-testing of the homemade KAP\ndescribed in Appendix B, and of the Directional\nFans covered by the instructions at the end of\nthis chapter.\nEven during a heat wave in a hot part of the\nUnited States, endurable conditions can be main-\ntained in a fully occupied, belowground shelter with\nthis simple pump, if the test-proven requirements\nlisted below are ALL met.\nMost basement shelters and many aboveground\nshelters also can be kept at livable temperatures in\nhot weather if the cooling methods listed below are\nALL followed:\n\u2022 Supply enough air to carry away all the shelter\noccupants\u0027 body heat without raising the \u0022effective\ntemperature\u0022 of the air at the exhaust end of the\nshelter by more than 2\u00B0F. The \u0022effective tempera-\nture\u0022 of the air to which a person is exposed is\nequivalent to the temperature of air at 100%relative\nhumidity thatcauses the same sensation of warmth or\ncold. \u0022Effective temperature\u0022 combines the effects of\nthe temperature of the air, its relative humidity, and\nits movement. An ordinary thermometer does not\nmeasure effective temperature. In occupancy tests of\ncrowded shelters when the supply of outdoor air was\nhot and dry, shelter occupants have been surprised to\nfind that they felt hottest at the air-exhaust end of\ntheir shelter, where the temperature reading was\nlower than at the air-intake end. Their sweaty bodies\nhad acted as evaporative air coolers, but their body\nheat had raised the effective temperature, a reliable\nindicator of heat stress. If40cubicfeet per minute(40\ncfm) per person of. outdoor air is supplied and\nproperly distributed, then (even if the outdoor air is\nat a temperature which is typical of the hottest hours\nduring a heat wave in a hot, humid area ofthe United\nStates) the effective temperature ofthe shelterairwill\nbe increased no more than 2\u00B0F by the shelter\noccupants\u0027 body heat and water vapor. Except for a\nrelatively fewsick peopledependent on aircondition-\ning, anyone could endure air that has an effective\ntemperature only 2\u00B0F higher than that of the air\noutdoors.\n(There are exceptions to this ventilation require-\nment when the ceiling or walls of basement or\naboveground shelters in buildings are heated by the\nsun to levels higher than skin temperature. In such\nshelters, more than 40 cfm of outdoor air per\noccupant must be supplied. However, if a shelter is\ncovered by at least two feet of earth, it will be so well\ninsulated that its ceiling and walls will not get hot\nenough to heat the occupants.)\n\u2022 Move the air gently, so as not to raise its\ntemperature. In the aforementioned Navy test, a high\nspeed, electric ventilating pump and the frictional\nresistance of pipes and filters raised the temperature\nof the air supplied to the shelter by 3\u00B0F. Under\nextreme heat wave conditions, an air supply 3\u00B0F\nhotter than outdoor air could be disastrous-espe-\ncially ifconsiderably less than 40 cfm per occupant is\nsupplied, and body heat raises the air temperature\nseveral additional degrees.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":59,"content":"\u2022 Distribute the air quite evenly throughout the\nshelter.

When the ventilation rate is low, smoking\nshould not be permitted,even nearthe exhaust opening.\n\u2022 Headaches, collapse, or death due to carbon\nmonoxide from open fires or gasoline lanterns that\nrelease gases into the shelter air.\nNATURAL VENTILATION\nEnough air usually will be blown through an\naboveground shelter if sufficiently large openings are\nprovided on opposite sides and if there is any breeze.\nBut if the weather is warm and still and the shelter\ncrowded, the temperature-humidity conditions soon\ncan become unbearable.\nAdequate natural ventilation for belowground\nshelters is more difficult.

Then earth was piled onto the parts of\nthe film strips that were lying on the ground, to\nsecure them. Finally, earth was piled against\nthe vertical parts of the attached film strips.\nFig. 6.3.

The stabilized clouds of such\nexplosions would be mostly in the troposphere,\nand some of even the tiniest particles - those\nsmall enough to be breathed into one\u0027s lungs -\nwould be promptly scavenged and deposited in\nscattered \u0022hot spots.\u0022 Fortunately, most of the\nvery small and tiniest fallout particles would\nnot be deposited for days to months, by which\ntime radioactive decay would have made them\nmuch lessdangerous. Breathingtiny radioactive\nparticles into one\u0027s lungs would constitute a\nminor health hazard compared to otherdangers\nthat would afflict an unprepared people sub-\njected to a large scale nuclear attack.\nSCAVENGING OF RADIOACTIVE\nPARTICLES\nScavenging is most effective below about\n30,000 feet, the maximum height of most rain\nand snow clouds. See Fig. 6.4. Because the\nSoviets have deployed thousands of ICBMs\nwith warheads of \u0022only\u0022 100 to 550 kilotons,\nAmericans face increased dangers from very\nradioactive particles scavenged by rain-outs or\nsnow-outs. The resultant \u0022hot spots\u0022 of fallout\nheavy enough to kill unsheltered people in a\nfew weeks could be scattered even hundreds of\nmiles downwind from areas of multiple explo-\nsions, especially missile fields. PrudentAmeri-\ncans, even those living several hundred miles\nfrom important targets, whenever practical\nshould equiptheir shelters with adequate venti-\nlating pumps and dust filters.\nThis potential dangerfrom extremely small\nfallout particles will be worsened if the United\nStates deploys mobile ICBMs such as Midget-\nman, probablyon large military reservations in\nthe West. (The Soviet Union already has mobile\nICBMs in its nuclear forces.) In the event of a\nSovietattack, ourhard-to-targetmobile missiles\nprobably would be subjected to a barrage of\nrelatively small warheads air-bursted so as to\nblanket their deployment areas. The resultant\nlarge clouds of extremely small radioactive\nparticles in the troposphere usually would be\nblown eastward, and resultantlife-endangering\n\u0022hot spots\u0022 from rain-outs and/or snow-outs\ncould be scattered clear to the Atlantic coast.\nFortunately, even in many expedient shel-\nters completed in a few days, filtered air can be\nprovided by using a homemade KAP to pump\nairthrough furnace or air-conditionerfilters, as\ndescribed in the last section of Appendix B. To\nlearn how you can supply a shelter at low cost\nwith air so well filtered that essentially all\nextremely small fallout particles and infective\naerosols are removed, see Appendix E, How To\nMake a Homemade Plywood Double-Action\nPiston Pump and Filter.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":62,"content":"These worsening potential dangers from\nextremely small \u0022hot\u0022 fallout particles brought\npromptly to earth by scavenging are not likely\nto endanger nearly as many Americans\u0027 lives\nas would24-hourfalloutof much largerparticles\nfrom surface and near-surface explosions.

(Most\nhouses willburn to the ground in lessthan two hours.)\nWhen an attack isexpected. a shelter, occupied\nor soon to be occupied, should be kept as cool as\npractical by pumping large volumes of outdoor\nair through it when the outdoor air is cooler\nthan the shelter air.

I regretthat\nno one rediscovered this premechanization,\nsimple, yet effective way of manually pumping\nair until after the original Nuclear War Survival\nSkills was published.\nIn 1980,Dr. William Olsen,a NASAresearch\nengineer long concerned with improving self-\nhelp civil defense, rediscovered one kind of\nDirectional Fanning. Since then, with the as-\nsistance of able Americans and others, I have\ndesigned andtested severaltypes of Directional\nFans. I have field-tested and repeatedly im-\nprovedthe instructionstoenableaveragepeople\nto quickly learn how to make and use such fans\neffectively.\nThe greatadvantageofDirectionalFanning\nis that almost anyone who is given the field-\ntested instructions can quickly make and use\none of these simple fans. Only very widely\navailable materials are needed. The main dis-\nadvantage is thatDirectionalFanningis a more\nlaborious way to ventilate a shelter than using\nKAPs, as described in detail in Appendix B.\nAmericans are not likely to receive Direc-\ntional Fanning instructions from the Federal\nEmergency ManagementAgency. FEMA\u0027spre-\ndecessors, the Office of Civil Defense and the\nDefense Civil Preparedness Agency, were un-\nable to get the millions of dollars necessary to\nbuy factory-made KAPs and other manual air\npumps to ventilate officially.designated fallout\nshelters, and FEMA has avoided shelter venti-\nlating controversies. No widely available offi-\ncialAmericanpublicationincludes instructions\nfor making and using any expedient air-\npumping device.\nThankstoCongressmanIkeSkelton,Demo-\ncrat of Missouri and strong civil defense\nadvocate, in 1981 I was able to demonstrate\nDirectional Fanning to Louis Giuffrida, at that\ntime the Director of FEMA. I gave Directional\nFans to the FEMA specialists concerned with\nshelter ventilation, all of whom have since left\nFEMA. To date, although Directional Fanning\ninstructions have been reproduced in three pri-\nvate civil defense publications, and some 600\ncopies of a metric version of the instructions\nwere distributedto British civil defense profes-\nsionalsatthe 1984AnnualStudyof CivilDefence\nand Emergency Planning Officers, FEMA has\nnot even evaluated Directional Fanning.\nIn contrast, in 1981 I gave copies ofinstruc-\ntions for both KAPs and Directional Fans to Dr.\nYin Zhi-shu, the Director of the People\u0027s Repu-\nblic of China\u0027s National Research and Design\nInstitute of Civil Defense - and the next day he\nstarted evaluating these simple devices. (At\nthat time I was traveling extensively in China\nas an official guest, exchanging civil defense\ninformation.) Dr. Yin, who heads all Chinese\ncivil defense research and development, went\nwith his top ventilation and shelter design\nspecialis.ts to a furniture factory in Beijing.\nThere I watched workmen quickly build both a\nlarge and a small KAP, and also Directional\nFans. Then Dr. Yin and his specialists began\nusing their air-velocity meters to measure the\nvolumes of air that these simple devices could\npump. On the following days I participated in\nmore ventilation tests using KAPs and Direc-\ntional Fans in tunnel blast shelters in Beijing\nand in the port city of Dalien.\nWhile watching these top Chinese civil\ndefense professionals make and test KAPs and\nDirectional Fans, I kept thinking: \u0022This is the\nway Thomas Edison and Henry Ford would\nhave evaluatedsimpledevicesof possible great\nimportance to millions.\u0022\nThe reader is urged to keep the following\ntwo pages of Directional Fanning instructions\nready for reproduction in a crisis. The sections\non the small 2-handled Directional Fan and the\nlarge 1-Man Fan will be the most useful to\nunprepared people. Ventilation by pairs of men\nusing Bedsheet Fans is an effective method for\nforcing very large volumes of outdoor air\nthrough tunnels, corridors and mines with ceil-\nings at least 9 feet high - provided they have\ntwo large openings.

With this small 2-\nhandled fan you quite easily can force\nabout 300 cubic feet per minute (300\nefm)of outdoorair through a crowded\ntrench or basement shelter. This is\nenough air for up to 9 adults crowded\ninto a small shelter in extremely hot.\nhumid weather, and enough for about\n100 people in cold weather. By fanning\nvigorously, 500 to 600 cubic feet per\nminute have been forced through a\nsmall covered-trench shelter.\nTo make a durable 2-handled fan, first make its frame oufof2 sticks each\n14 inches long and 2 sticks each 22 inches long. See sketch. To strengthen\nthe corners, overlap the sticks about one-half inch, as shown.\nWhen using sticks cut from a tree, select ones with diameters of about %\ninch, and make shallow notches in all 4 sticks before tying together the 4\ncorners of the blade. If you do not have strong string, use %-inch-wide strips\nof bedsheet cloth, or other strong cloth, slightly twisted.\nIf using sawed sticks, be sure to use none smaller than b x31\u003C inch in cross\nsection. If you have very small nails or brads, use only one to connect each\ncorner; then tie each corner securely. To prevent possible blistering of\nhands, wrap cloth around the fan handles, or wear gloves.\nTo cover the fan\u0027s blade, any strong, light fabric, such as bedsheet cloth,\nserves welLIfyou are going to sew on the cloth, first cut a 26 x30-inch piece.\nWrap the 30-inch width smoothly crosswise around the frame, aftercutting4\nnotches in the cloth\u0027s corners, so that the tied-together parts of the sticks will\nnot be covered. Pin or tape the cloth to make a smooth blade; finally sew\nsecurely. (If waterproof construction adhesive is available, a smaller piece of\ncloth can be used and the blade can be covered ill a very few minutes.)\nIf time and/or materials are very limited, make a fanwith its blade\nmerely a piece ofcloth connecting two 22-inch-long sticks, This very\nsimple fan is reasonably effective, although tiring to use.\nCardboard covering a blade is likely to become damp and fragile in the\nhumid air of a crowded shelter. Very light sheetmetalmakes a good fan blade\nand requires only 2 sticks. A blade of \u0027I4-inch plywood is too heavy.\nIf no sticks are available, a double thickness of heavy, stiff cardboard 22\ninches long by 14 inches wide will pump almost as much air if used as a\nhandleless fan. The pieces should be securely tied or taped together. If\nwaterproof tape is available, cover the parts that you will grip with sweaty\nhands, thus preventing dampening and softening the cardboard.\nFor maximum ventilation, the air-intake opening of a shelter should be at\nleast as large as its air-exhaust opening. (If the air-exhaust opening of your\nsmall shelter is much larger than that shown in the sketches, block part of it\noff to reduce it to approximately this 24-inch-high by 20-inch-wide size, for\nmore effective use with this fan.) The air should be fanned out of the shelter\nin the direction in which the air is naturally flowing. Formaximum ventilation\nrate, fan about 40 strokes per minute.\nDirectional Fanning is the simplest way to force enough outdoor air\nthrough typical basement; trench, and other expedient shelters to maintain\nendurable conditions, even in extremely hot, humid weather.\nDuring a worsening nuclear crisis most unprepared citizens probably\nwill not have the time and/or materials needed to make a KAP or other\nefficient shelter-ventilating pump - even if they have the instructions. In\ncontrast. tests with average citizens have indicated that if they have\ninstructions for making and using Directional Fans and if there are a few\nhours of warning time before the attack, then the majority will be able to\nventilate all of their expedient shelters, except some of the largest.\nThe principal disadvantage of Directional Fans is that they are more\nlaborious tooperate than are KAPs, thatare manually powered, pendulum-\nlike air pumps that conserve energy.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":66,"content":"60\nA durable but laboriously heavy fan can be made in a few minutes using a\n20 x 30-inch piece of I/,-inch plywood nailed to a single 46-inch-Iong, 1 x 2-\ninch hoard.

However,\ntypical cardboard will become soft and worthless in most crowded, long-\noccupied, humid shelters.\nTo fan directionally, it is best to stand just outside and to one side of a\ndoorway. so that your body does not obstruct the air flow.

See sketch on preceding\npage.\nWhenever practical, directionally fan the air in the same direction that\nthe air is naturally flowing through the shelter. More air usually can be\npumped through a shelter if the fan is used to force air out through the air-\nexhaust opening. This reduces the air pressure inside the shelter and causes\nfresh outdoor air to be \u0022sucked\u0022 into the shelter through the air-intake\ndoorway, or through other large air-intake openings. Thus with one fan 1,000\ncubic feet per minute can be pumped through a fully occupied shelter. This is\nenough outdoor air - if it is properly distributed within the shelter - to\nmaintain tolerable conditions for weeks for 25 occupants during extremely\nhot weather, and for up to about 300 occupants during cold weather.\nTo ventilate and cool a room having only one doorway and no other\nopening, do not block off any part of the doorway. Ifair is fanned into such a\nroom through the lowerpart of its completelyopendoorway, thenairwillflow\nback out of the room through the upper part of the doorway. However, this\npumps much less air than when a separate, large air-exhaust opening is\nprovided.\nTo increase the flow of outdoor air through a tunnel-shelter, several\nfanners equallyspaced alongits length should each fan in the directionofthe\nnatural air flow. This procedure was first proved practical during a 1981\nventilation test that Cresson H. Kearny participated in with Chinese civil\ndefense officials in the port city of Dalien. In this test 5 fanners. each with a\nfan of approximately the size illustrated, forced air from the outdoors\nthrough a 395-footsection between two opened entrancesofa typical Chinese\ntunnel-shelter. The air flow was increased from a natural flow of 290 cubic\nfeet per minute to 3,680cubic feet per minute. The 5excellent Chinese fans\neach had a blade madeofa pieceof 3 mm (approx. Ysinch)plywood nailed toa\nsingle board.\nWith many more pairs of Bedsheet Fanners working, enough air for at\nleast 10,000 occupants could be \u0022sucked\u0022 intothis mine throughone of its 17\nx 20-foot portals, fanned down a corridor to the far \u0022dead end\u0022 of the mine,\nthen fanned through a cross corridor, and finally fanned back outthrough the\ncorridor that has the second truck-sized portal at its outer end.\nA pair of pre-mechanization coal miners produced a directed airflow by\nholding a piece of canvas vertically between them while they quickly walked\na short ways in the direction ofthe desired airflow; they walked back with the\ncanvas held horizontally between them. Then they repeated.\n1. No installation is needed, thus saving working time and materials for\nmaking habitable shelters hurriedly built or upgraded during a crisis.\n2. Directional Fans enable shelter occupants to quickly reverse the\ndirection of air flow through their shelter when outdoor wind changes cause\nthe direction of natural air flow to be reversed.\n3. Four or more Directional Fans when used to circulate air within a\nshelterroom can serve like air ducts, while simultaneously fanning occupants.\n4. Directional Fans are very unlikely to be damaged by blast effects\nsevere enough to wreck bladed fans or other fixed ventilation devices placed\nat or near air-intake or air-exhaust openings, but not severe enough to injure\nshelter occupants.\nC. ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF DIRECTIONAL FANS\nCHANGE HAND\nPOSITIONS\nWHILE MOVING FAN\nHORIZONTALLY BACK\nTO STARTING\nPOSITION\nThe practicality of using Bedsheet Fans to ventilate some very large\nmines or caves having 2 or more large openings was proved by tests with\nmembers of the Citizens Preparedness Group of GreaterKansas City. These\ntests were conducted in 1982 nearKansas CIty in a huge limestone mine that\nhas a ceiling averaging about 17 feet high, corridors about 35 feet wide,\ncolumns of unexcavated rock about 15 feet square, and over 1,000,000\nsquare feet of level, dry floor space. The airinside is\u0022dead\u0022, remarkably still,\nbecause the only openings are two truck-sized portals on one side of the\nmine. Five pairs of Bedsheet Fanners, spaced about 75 feet apart down a\ncorridor, after fanning for several minutes produced a measured air flow of\napproximately 100.000 cubic feet per minute through this part of this\ncorridor!\n2. With a Bedsheet Fan\nl.\u0027se a 2-man Bedsheet Fan to force thousands of cubic feet per minute of\noutdoor air through a tunnel or long corridor having at least a 9-foot ceiling\nand a large opening at each end. The most practical design tested was made\nfrom a strong double bedsheet cut down to 6-foot width, with the wide hem at\nits head-end left unchanged and with a similar-sized hem sewn in its opposite\nend. to give a finished lengthof6 feet.

Direct blast\neffects would be first, covering a large fraction of\ndensely populated areas and killing far more people.\nConsiderably fewer fatalities seem likely to result\nfrom the second-ranking danger, fallout radiation.\nTHE FACTS ABOUT FIRE HAZARDS\nFirestorms would endanger relatively few\nAmericans; only the older parts of a few American\ncities have buildings close enough together, over a\nlarge enough area, to fuel this type of conflagration.\nSuch fires have not occurred in cities where less than\nabout 30% of a large area was covered with\nbuildings.\u0022\nIn the blast area of Hiroshima, a terrifying fire\nstorm thatburned almost all buildings withinan area\nof about 4.4 square miles resulted from many fires\nbeing ignited almost simultaneously. Many were\ncaused by heat radiation from the fireball. Even more\nfires were due to secondary effects of the blast, such\nas the overturning of stoves. The buildingscontained\nmuch wood and other combustible materials. The\nwhole area burned like a tremendous bonfire; strong\nwinds that blew in from all directions replaced the\nhuge volumes of hot air that rose skyward from the\nintense fires.\nLack of oxygen is not a hazard to occupants of\nshelters in or near burning buildings or to those in\nshelters that are closed tightly to prevent the entry of\nsmoke or fallout.

This\ntest house had no furnishings, but the heat was\nintense enough to have ignited exposed upholstery,\ncurtains, bedding, papers, etc. in a typical home.\nHeat radiation. will set fire to easily ignitable\nmaterials (dry newspapers, thin dark fabrics, dry\nleaves and dry grass) in about the same extensive\nareas over which blast causes moderate damage to\nframe houses. The blast wave and high-speed blast\nwinds will blowout many flames. However, tests\nhave shown that fire will continue to smolder within\nsome materials such as upholstery and dry rotted\n.wood, and after a while it often will burst into flame\nand will spread. The burning automobile pictured in\nFig. 7.2 is an example of such ignition beyond the\nrange of severe blast damage.\nThe number of fires started by heat radiation in\nareas where blast is not severe can be reduced by\nwhitewashing the insides of window panes and by\nremoving flammable materials from places in and\naround houses where heat radiation could reach\nthem. Also, occupants of shelters in some homes that\nwould be only slightly damaged by blast could move\nquickly to extinguish small fires and throw out\nsmoldering upholstered articles before fallout is\ndeposited.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":68,"content":"Fig. 7.1.

Some water mains were broken, which\nmade water unavailable for firefighting in certain\nareas.\nIn the event of an attack on the United States\nemploying many surface bursts, fallout would\nprevent firefighting for days to weeks in a large part\nof the most populated regions.\nThe basements of many substantial buildings\nwill withstand 5-psi blast effects and can prevent\noccupants from suffering serious injuries from blast.\nMost home basements can be reinforced with stout\nboards and posts so as to give good protection\nagainst blast effects up to considerably. hig~er than\n5 psi.

We take for granted that we will always\nhave enough water to drink. Most of us think of\n\u0022food and water\u0022 in that order, when we think of.\nsurvival essentials that should be stored. But if\nunprepared citizens were confined in a shelter by\nheavy fallout, they soon would realize that they\nshould have given first priority to storing adequate\nwater.\nFor the kidneys to eliminate waste products\neffectively, the average person needs to drink enough\nwater so that he urinates at least one pint each day.\n(When water is not limited, most people drink\nenough to urinate 2 pints. Additional water is lost in\nperspiration, exhaled breath, and excrement.) Under\ncool conditions, a personcouldsurvive for weeks on 3\npints of water a day-if he eats but little food and if\nthat food islow in protein. Coolconditions, however,\nwould be the exception in crowded belowground\nshelters occupied for many days. Under such\ncircumstances four or five quarts of drinking water\nper day are essential in very hot weather, with none\nallowed for washing. For a two-week shelter stay, 15\ngallons per person should be stored in or close to a\nshelter. This amount usually would provide for some\nwater remaining after two weeks, to prevent thirst in\ncase fallout dangers were to continue.\nIn a 1962Navy shelteroccupancy test lastingtwo\nweeks, 99 sailors each consumed an average of 2.4\nquarts (2.3 liters) of water per day.\u0022 The test was\nconducted in August near Washington, D.C.; the\nweather was unseasonably cool. The shelter was not\nair-conditioned except during the last two days of the\ntest.\nWhen one is sweating heavily and not eating\nsalty food, salt deficiency symptoms-s-especially\ncramping-are likely to develop within a few days.\nTo prevent this, 6 or 8grams of salt (about 1/4oz, or 1/2\ntablespoon) should be consumed daily in food and\ndrink. Iflittle or no food iseaten, this small dailysalt\nration should be added to drinking water. Under hot\nconditions, a little salt makes water taste better.\nCARRYING WATER\nMost families have only a few large containers\nthat could be used for carrying water to a shelter and\nstoring it in adequate amounts for several weeks.\nPolyethylene trash bags make practical expedient\nwater containers when used as waterproof liners\ninside smaller fabric bags or pillowcases. (Plastic\nbags labeled as being treated with insecticides or\nodor-controlling chemicals should not be used.)\nFigure 8.1 shows a teenage boy carrying over 10\ngallons (more than 80 pounds) of water, well\nbalanced front and back for efficient packing.

The other end of this rope should then be\ntied to some support, to keep the openings higher\nthan the water level.\nTo use two fabnc bags or pillowcases to carry a\nheavy load of water contained in larger plastic liner-\nbags, connect the two fabric bags as shown in Fig. 8.1.\nA small pebble, a lump of earth, or a similar\nobject should be tied inside the opening of each bag\nbefore the two are tied together, to hold them\nsecurely.

The\nthick earth cover over the flexible roofing gives\u0027\nexcellent blast protection, due to the earth arching\nthat develops under blast pressure. In a large Defense\nNuclear Agencyblasttest,a filled water-storage pit of\nthe size illustrated was undamaged by blast effects at\nan overpressure range which could demolish the\nstrongest aboveground buildings (53 psi).\nA simpler way to store waterisillustrated in Fig.\n8.4. If the soil is so unstable that an unshored water\nstorage pit with vertical sides cannot be dug, the\nopening of the bag (or of one bag placed inside\nanother) can simply be tied shut so as to minimize\nleakage (see Fig. 8.4). Fill the bag with water, tie it,\nand place it in the pit. Then bury it with earth to the\nlevel of the water inside. A disadvantage of this\nmethod is leakage through the tied-shut openingsdue\nto pressure of loose earth on the bag. To lessen\nleakage, leave an air space between the filled bag and\na roofing of board or sticks, so\u0027 that the weight of\nearth piled on top of the roofing will not squeeze the\nbag. This storage method has another disadvantage:\nafter the earthcoveringand the roofare removed, it is\ndifficult to bailout the water for use-because as\nwater is bailed out, the loose surrounding earth\nmoves inward and squeezes the bag above the\nlowered water level.\nLarge volumes of water can be stored in plastic-\nlined rectangular pits. In order to roof them with\nwidely available materials such as ordinary 3/4-inch\nplywood or small poles, the pits should be dug no\nwider than 3 feet.

Therefore, water\nshould be obtained from the least radioactive sources\navailable. Before a supply of stored drinking water\nhas been exhausted, othersources should be located.\nThe main water sources are given below, with the\nsafest source listed first and the othersources listed in\ndecreasing order of safety.\n1. Water from deep wells and from water tanks\nand covered reservoirs into which no fallout particles\nor fallout-contaminated water has been introduced.\n(Caution: Although most spring waterwould be safe,\nsome spring water is surface water that has flowed\ninto and through underground channels without\nhaving been filtered.)\n2. Water from covered seepage pits or shallow,\nhand-dug wells. This water is usually safe IF fallout\nor fallout-contaminated surface water has been\nprevented from entering by the use of waterproof\ncoverings and by waterproofing the surrounding\nground to keep water from running down outside the\nwell casing. Figure 8.9 is taken from a Chinese civil\ndefense manual.\u0022 It shows a well dug to obtain safe\nwater from a fallout-contaminated source. If the\nearth is not sandy, gravelly, or too porous, filtration\nthrough earth is very effective.\n3. Contaminated water from deep lakes. Water\nfrom a deep lake would be much lesscontaminated by\ndissolved radioactive material and fallout particles\nthan water from a shallow pond would be, ifboth had\nthe same amount of fallout per square foot ofsurface\narea deposited in them. Furthermore, fallout parti-\ncles settle to the bottom more rapidly in deep lakes\nthan in shallow ponds, which are agitated more by\nwind.\n4.

He may not realize that\nfor most people food would not be essential for\nsurvival during the first two or three weeks following\na nuclear attack. Exceptions would be infants, small\nchildren, and the aged and sick, some of whom might\ndie within a week without proper nourishment. Other\nthings are more important for short-term survival:\nadequate shelter against the dangers from blast and\nfallout, an adequate supply of air, and enough\nwater.\nThe average American also may not realize that\nsmall daily amounts of a few unprocessed staple\nfoods would enable him to survive for many months,\nor even for years. A healthy person-s-if he is deter-\nmined to live and if he learns how to prepare and\nuse whole-grain wheat or corn-can maintain his\nhealth for several months. Ifbeans are also available\nand are substituted for some of the grain, the ration\nwould be improved and could maintain health for\nmany months.\nThe nutritional information given inthis chapter\nis taken from a July, 1979 publication, Maintaining\nNutritional Adequacy During a Prolonged Food\nCrisis,\u0022 This book brings together from worldwide\nsources the nutritional facts needed to help unpre-\npared people use unaccustomed foods advanta-\ngeously during the prolonged crisis that would follow\na heavy nuclear attack. The practical know-how\nwhich will be given in this chapter regarding the\nexpedient processing and cooking of basic grains\nand beans is based on old ways which are mostly\nunknown to modern Americans. These methods have\nbeen improved and field-tested by civil defense\nresearchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nA mass-ive nuclear attack would eliminate the\nluxurious, complicated American system of food\nproduction, processing, and distribution. Extensive,\nheavy fallout and the inability of farmers to feed\ntheir animals would kill most of the cattle, hogs, and\nchickens that are, the basis of our high-protein diet.\nThe livestock most likely to survive despite their\nowners\u0027 inability to care for them would be cattle on\npasture. However, these grazing animals would\nswallow large numbers of fallout particles alongwith\ngrass, and many would drink contaminated water.\nTheir digestive tracts would suffer severe radiation\ndamage.\u0022 Also, they would suffer radiation burns\nfrom fallout particles. Thus in an outdoorareawhere\nthe total dose from gamma radiation emitted within\na fewdays from fallout particles on the ground might\nbe only 150 R, most grazing animals probably would\nbe killed by the combined effects of external gamma-\nray radiation, beta burns, and internal radiation.\u0022\nPRECAUTIONS WHEN EATING MEAT\nIn areas where the fallout would not be enough\nto sicken animals, their meat would be safe food. In\nfallout areas, however, animals that have eaten or\ndrunk fallout-contaminated food or water will have\nconcentrated radioactive atoms and molecules in\ntheir internal organs. The thyroid gland, kidneys,\nand liver especially should not be eaten.\nIf an animal appears to be sick, it should not be\neaten. The animal might be sufferingfrom a sickening\nor fatal radiation dose and might have developed a\nbacterial infection as a result of this dose. Meat\ncontaminated with the toxins produced by some\nkinds of bacteria could cause severe illness or death\nif eaten, even if thoroughly cooked.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":82,"content":"Under cnsis conditions, all meat should be\ncooked until it is extremely well done-cooked long\npast the time when it loses the last of its pink color.\nTo be sure that the center of each piece of meat is\nraised to boiling temperature, the meat should be cut\ninto pieces that are less than Ih-inch thick before\ncooking. This precaution also reducescooking time\nand saves fuel.\nSURVIVAL OF BREEDING STOCK\nExtensive areas of the United States would not\nreceive fallout heavy enough to kill grazing animals.\nThe millions of surviving animals would provide\nsome food and the fertile breeding stock needed for\nnational recovery. The loss \u0027of fertility caused by\nsevere radiation doses is rarely permanent. Extensive\nexperiments with animals have shown that the\noffspring of severely irradiated animals are healthy\nand fertile.\u0022\nLIVING ON BASIC PLANT FOODS\nEven if almost all food-producing animals were\nlost, most surviving Americans should be able to\nlive on the foods that enable most of the world\u0027s\npopulation to live and multiply: grains, beans, and\nvegetables. And because of the remarkable produc-\ntivity of American agriculture, there usually would\nbe enough grain and beans in storage to supply\nsurviving Americans with sufficient food for at least\na year following a heavy nuclear attack.\u0022 The\nproblem would be to get the unprocessed foods,\nwhich are stored in food-producing regions, to the\nmajority of survivors who would be outside these\nregions.\nSurprisingly little transportation would be\nneeded to carry adequate quantities of these un-\nprocessed foods to survivors in famine areas. Asingle\nlarge trailer truck can haul 40,000 pounds of\nwheat-enough to keep 40,000 people from feeling\nhunger pains for a day. More than enough such\ntrucks and the fuel needed to carry basic foods to\nfood-short areas would survive a massive nuclear\nattack.\u0022 It is likely that reasonably strong American\nleadership and morale would prevail so that, after\nthe first few weeks, millions of the survivors in\nstarving areas should receive basic unprocessed\nfoods.\nEating food produced in the years after a large\nattack would cause an increase in the cancer rate,\ndue primarily to its content of radioactive strontium\nand cesium from fallout-contaminated soil. Over the\nfirst 30 years following an attack, this increasewould\nbe a small fraction ofthe number ofadditionalcancer\ndeaths that would result from external radiation.\u0022\nCancer deaths would be one of the tragic, delayed\ncosts of a nuclear war, but all together would not be\nnumerous enough to endangerthe long-term survival\nof the population.\nLIVE OFF THE LAND?\nVery few survivors of a heavy attack would be\nin areas where they could live off the land like\nprimitive hunters and gatherers. In extensive areas\nwhere fallout would not be heavy enough to kill\nhuman beings, wild creatures would die from the\ncombi-ned effects \u0027of external gamma radiation,\nswallowed fallout particles, and beta burns on their\nbodies. Survival plans should not includedependence\non hunting, fishing, or gathering wild plants.\nFOOD FOR SHELTER OCCUPANTS\nMost people would need very little food to live\nseveral weeks; however, the time when survivors\nof blast and fallout would leave their shelters would\nmark the beginning of a much longer period of\nprivation and hard manual labor. Therefore, to\nmaintain physical strength and morale, persons in\nshelters ideally should have enough healthful food\nto provide well-balanced, adequate meals for many\nweeks.\nIn most American homes there are only enough\nready-to-eat, concentrated foods to last a few days.\nObviously, it would be an important survival ad-\nvantage to keep on hand a two-week supply of easily\ntransportable foods. In any case, occupants of\nshelters would be uncertain about when they could\nget more food and would have to make hard decisions\nabout how much to eat each day. (Those persons\nwho have a fallout meter, such as the homemade\ninstrument described in Chapter 10, could estimate\nwhen and for how long they could emerge from\nshelter to find food. As a result, these persons could\nration their limited foods more effectively.)\nDuring the first few weeks of a food crisis, lack\nof vitamins and other essentials of a well-balanced\ndiet would not be of primary importance to pre-\nviously well-nourished people.

It isvitally important to national recovery\nand individualsurvival to get back as soonas possible\nto labor-saving, mechanized ways of doing essential\nwork.\nIn an ORNL experiment, a farmer used a\nJohn Deere Grinder-Mixer powered by a lOO-hp\ntractor to grind large samples of wheat and barley.\nWhen it is used to grind rather coarse meal for hogs,\nthis machine is rated at 12tons per hour. Set to grind\na finer meal-flour mixture for human consumption,\nit ground both hard wheat and feed barley at a rate\nof about 9 tons per hour. This is 2400 times as fast\nas using muscle power to operate even the best ex-\npedient grain mill. With its finest screen installed,\nthis large machine can produce about 3tons of whole\nwheat flour per hour.\nUnlike wheat and corn, the kernels of barley,\ngrain sorghums, and oats have rough, fibrous hulls\nthat must be removed from the digestible parts to\nproduce an acceptable food. Moistening the grain\nwill toughen such hulls and make them easier to\nremove. If the grain is promptly pounded orground\ninto meal, the toughened hulls will break into larger\npieces than will the hulls of undampened grain. A\nsmall amount of water, weighing about 2% of the\nweight of the grain, should be used to dampen the\ngrain. For 3 pounds of grain (about 6 cups), sprinkle\nwith about one ounce (28 grams, or about 2\ntablespoons) of water, while stirring constantly to\nmoisten all the kernels. After about 5 minutes of\nstirring, the grain will appear dry. The small amount\nof water will have dampened and toughened the\nhulls, but the edible parts\u0027inside will have remained\ndry. Larger pieces of hull are easier to remove after\ngrinding than smaller pieces.\nOne way to remove ground-up hulls from meal\nis by flotation. Put some of the meal-hulls mixture\nabout I inch deep in a pan or pot, cover the mixture\nwith water, and stir. Skim off the floating hulls,\nthen pouroffthe waterand more hulls. Sunken pieces\nof hulls that settle on top of the heavier meal can be\nremoved with one\u0027s fingers as the last of the water\nis poured off. To produce a barley meal good for\nvery small children, the small pieces of hulls must\nagain be separated by flotation.\nFigure 9.1 illustrates sieving fine, dry barley-\nmeal and the smaller pieces ofhulls from the coarser\nFig. 9.I.

Most shelter\noccupants soon would consume all of their ready-\nto-eat foods; therefore, they should have portable,\nefficient cook stoves. A cook stove is important for\nanother reason: to help maintain morale. Even in\nwarm weather, people need some hot food and drink\nfor the comforting effect and to promote a sense\nof well-being. This is particularly true when people\nare under stress.

To\navoid denting the side of the bucket when chiseling\nout the hole, place the bucket over the end of a logor\nsimilar solid object.\nTo make the damper, cut a 6-inch-wide by\nlO-inch-high piece out of a large fruit-juice can or\nfrom similar light metal. Then make the two coat-\nhanger-wire springs illustrated, and attach them to\nthe piece of metal by bending and hammering the\nouter I inch of the two 6-inch-Iong sides over and\naround the two spring wires. This damper can be slid\nup and down, to open and close the hole in the\nbucket. The springs hold it inany desired position. (If\nmaterials for making this damper are not available,\nthe air supply can be regulated fairly well by placing\na brick, rock, or piece of metal so that it will block\noff part of the hole in the side of the bucket.)\nTo make a support for the pot, punch 4 holes\nin the sides of the bucket, equally spaced around it\nand about 31/2 inches below the bucket\u0027s top. Then\nrun a coat-hanger wire through each of the two pairs\nof holes on opposite sides of the bucket. Bend these\ntwo wires over the top of the bucket, as illustrated, so\nthat their four ends form free-ended springs to hold\nthe cooking pot centered in the bucket. Pressure on\nthe pot from these four free-ended, sliding springs\ndoes not hinder putting it into the stove or taking\nit out.\nBend and twist 4 or 5 coat hangers to make the\nmovable grate, best made with the approximate\ndimensions given in Fig. 9.2.\nFor adjusting the burning pieces offuel on the\ngrate, make a pair of 12-inch-Iong tongs of coat-\nhanger wire, as illustrated by Fig. 9.3.\nTo lessen heat losses through the sides and\nbottom of the bucket, cover the bottom with about\nI inch of dry sand or earth. Then line part of the inside\nand bottom with two thicknesses of heavy-duty\naluminum foil, if available.\nTo make it easier to place the pot in the stove\nor take it out without spilling itscontents, replace the\noriginal bucket handle with a longer piece of strong\nwire.\nOperation:\nThe Bucket Stove owes its efficiency to: (I) the\nadjustable air supply that flows up through the\nburning fuel, (2) the movable grate that lets the\noperator keep the maximum amount of flame in\ncontact with the bottom of the cooking pot, and\n(3) the space between the sides of the pot and the\ninside of the bucket that keeps the rising hot gases\nin close contact with the sides of the pot.\nIn a shelter, a Bucket Stove should be placed\nas near as practical to an air exhaust opening before\na fire is started in it.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":86,"content":"Fig. 9.2.

Under\nshelter conditions, the best way to cook such meal\nis first to bring the water to a boil (3 parts of water\nfor I part of meal). Add 1teaspoon (5 grams) of salt\nper pound of dry meal. Remove the pot from the fire\n(or stop adding fuel to a Bucket Stove) and quickly\nstir the meal into the hot water. (Ifthe meal isstirred\ninto briskly boiling water, lumping becomes a worse\nproblem.) Then, while stirring constantly, again\nbring the pot to a rolling boil.

This\nusually takes about 5 minutes. Continue to cook,\neither in the Fireless Cooker for at least 4 or 5 hours,\nor by boiling for an additional 15 or 20 minutes.\nWhen it is necessary to boil grain meal for many\nminutes, minimize sticking and scorching by cook-\ning I part of dry meal with at least 4 parts of water.\nHowever. cooking a thinner hot cereal has a dis-\nadvantage during a food crisis: an increased volume\nof food must be eaten to satisfy one\u0027s energy\nneeds.\nIf grain were the only food available, few\nAmericans doing physical work could eat enough\nof it to maintain their weight at first, until their\ndigestive tracts enlarged from eating the very bulky\nfoods. This adaptation could take a few months.\nSmall children could not adjust adequately to an\nall-grain diet: for them, concentrated foods such as\nfats also are needed to provide enough calories to\nmaintain growth and health.\n\u2022 Cooking Grain and Beans Together\nWhen soybeans are being used to supplement the\nlower quality proteins of grain and when fuel or pots\nare inshort supply, first grind or pound the beans into a\nfine meal. To further reduce cooking time, soak the\nbean meal for a couple ofhours, keeping itcovered with\nwateras itswells.

Also, whole soybeans must\nbe boiled for a couple of hours to soften them\nsufficiently. But if soybeans are pounded or ground\ninto a fine meal, and then 1partof the soybeanmeal\nis boiled with 4 parts of meal made from corn or\nanother grain, the soybeans give a pleasant\nsweetish taste to the resulting mush. The un-\npleasant soybean taste is eliminated. If cooked as\ndescribed above, soybeans and other beans or dried\npeas can be made digestible and palatable with mini-\nmum cooking.\n100% GRAIN AND 100% BEAN DIETS\nA diet consisting solely of wheat, corn, or rice,\nand salt has most of the essential nutrients. The\ncritical deficiencies would be vitamins A, C, and D.\nSuch a grain-based diet can serve adults and older\nchildren as their \u0022staff of life\u0022 for months. Table 9.1\nshows how less than 13(4 pounds of whole wheat\nor dry yellow corn satisfies most of the essential\nnutritional requirements of a long-term emergency\nration. [The nutritional values that are deficient are\nprinted in bold type, to make an easier comparison\nwith the Emergency Recommendations, also printed\nin bold type. Food energy is given in kilocalories\n(kcal), commonly called calories (Cal).] Expedient\nways of supplying the nutrients missing from these\nrations are described in a following section of this\nchapter.\nOther common whole grains would serve about\nas well as wheat and yellow corn. At least 1(6 oz of salt\nper day (about 5 grams) is essential for any ration\nthat is to be eaten for more than a few days, but \u0027t, oz\n(about 10 g or 3(4 tablespoon) should be available\nto allow for increased salt needs and to make grain\nand beans more palatable. This additional salt would\nbe consumed as needed.\nTo repeat: few Americans at first would be able\nto eat the 3 or 4 quarts of thick mush that would be\nnecessary with a ration consisting solely of whole-\nkernel wheat or corn. Only healthy Americans\ndetermined to survive would be likely to fare well\nfor months on such unaccustomed and monotonous\nfood as an all-graindiet. Eatingtwo or more different\nkinds of grain and cooking in different ways would\nmake an all-grain diet both more acceptable and\nmore nourishing.\nNot many people would be able to eat 27 oz\n(dry weight before cooking) of beans in a day, and\nfewer yet could eat a daily ration of almost 23 oz\nof soybeans. Beans as single-food diets are not\nrecommended because their large protein content\nrequires the drinking of more fluids. Roasted peanuts\nwould provide a better single-food ration.\nGRAIN SUPPLEMENTED WITH BEANS\nPeople who live on essentially vegetarian diets\neat a little of their higher-quality protein food at every\nmeal, along with the grain that is their main source\nof nutrition.

Captain James Cook wasable to keep hissailors\nfrom developing scurvy during a three-year voyage by\nhaving them drink an unfermented beer made from\ndried, sprouted barley. For centuries the Chinese have\nprevented scurvy during the long winters of northern\nChina by consuming sprouted beans.\nOnly IO mg of vitamin C taken each day (1/5 of\nthe smallest vitamin C tablet) is enough to prevent\nscurvy. Ifa little over an ounce (about 30grams) of dry\nbeans or dry wheat is sprouted until the sprouts are a\nlittle longer than the seeds, the sprouted seeds will\nsupply 10 to 15 mg of vitamin C. Such sprouting, if\ndone at normal room temperature, requires about 48\nhours. To preventsickness and to make sprouted beans\nmore digestible, the sprouted seeds should be boiled in\nwater for not longer than 2 minutes. Longer cooking\nwilldestroy too much vitamin C.\nUsual sprouting methods produce longer sprouts\nthan are necessary when production ofenough vitamin\nC is the objective. These methods involve rinsing the\nsprouting seeds several times a day in safe water. Since\neven survivors not confined to shelters are likely to be\nshort of water, the method illustrated in Fig. 9.5should\nbe used. First the seeds to be sprouted are picked clean\nof trash and broken seeds. Then the seeds are covered\nwith water and soaked for about 12hours. Next, the\nwater is drained off and the soaked, swollen seeds are\nplaced on the inside of a plastic bag or ajar, in a layer\nno more than an inch deep. Ifa plastic bag isused, you\nshould make two loose rolls of paper, crumple them a\nlittle, dampen them, and place them inside the bag,\nalong its sides. As shown in Fig. 9.5, these two\ndampened paper rolls keep the plastic from resting on\nthe seeds and form an air passage down the center of\nthe bag. Wetpapershould beplaced inthe mouth ofthe\nbag or jar so as to leave an air opening of only about I\nsquare inch. If this paper is kept moist, the seeds will\nremain sufficientlydampwhilereceivingenoughcircula-\ntingair to prevent molding.

Sprouting with minimum water.\nSprouting seeds also increases their content\nof riboflavin, niacin, and folic acid. Sprouted beans\nare more digestible than raw, urisprouted beans, but\nnot as easily digested or nourishing as are sprouted\nbeans that have been boiled or sauteed for a couple\nof minutes. Sprouting is not a substitute for cooking.\nContrary to the claims of some health food publi-\ncations, sprouting does not increase the protein\ncontent of seeds, nor does it improve protein quality.\nFurthermore, sprouting reduces the caloric value of\nseeds. The warmth generated by germinating seeds\nreduces their energy value somewhat, as compared\nto unsprouted seeds.\n\u2022 Vitamin A\nWell-nourished adults have enough vitamin A\nstored in their livers to prevent vitamin A deficiency\nproblems for several months, even if theirdiet during\nthat time contains none of this\u0027 essential vitamin.\nChildren would be affected by deficiencies sooner\nthan adults. The first symptom is an inability to see\nwell in dim light. Continuing deficiency causes\nchanges in body tissues. In infants and children,\nlack of vitamin A can result in stunted growth and\nserious eye problems-even blindness. Therefore, a\nsurvival diet should be balanced with respect to\nvitamin A as soon as possible, with children having\npriority.\nMilk, butter, and margarine are common\nvitamin A sources that would not be available to\nmost survivors. If these were no longer available,\nyellow corn, carrots, and green, leafy vegetables\n(including dandelion greens) would be the best\nsources. If these foods were not obtainable, the next\nbest source would be sprouted whole-kernel wheat\nor other grains-if seeds could be sprouted for three\ndays in the light, so that the sprouts are green.\nAlthough better than no source, sprouting is not\na very satisfactory way to meet vitamin A require-\nments. The development of fibrous roots makes\n3-day sprouted wheat kernels difficult to eat. And\none must eat a large amount of seeds with green\nsprouts and roots to satisfy the recommended daily\nemergency requirements-up to 51/ 2 cups of 5-day\nsprouted alfalfa seeds. Survivors of a nuclear attack\nwould wish they had kept an emergency store of\nmultivitamin pills.\n\u2022 Vitamin 0\nWithout vitamin D, calcium is not adequately\nabsorbed. As a result, infants and children would\ndevelop rickets (a disease of defective bone mineral-\nization). A massive nuclear attack would cut off\nthe vast majority of Americans from their main\nsource of Vitamin D, fortified milk.\nVitamin D can be formed in the body if the\nskin is exposed to the ultraviolet rays of the sun.\nInfants should be exposed to sunlight very cau-\ntiously, initially for only a few minutes-especially\nafter a massive nuclear attack. Such an attack\npossibly could causeatmospheric changes thatwould\npermit more ultraviolet light to reach the earth\u0027s\nsurface, causing sunburn in the U.S. as severe\nas on the equator today. In cold weather, maxi-\nmum exposure of skin to sunlight is best done in a\nshallow pit shielded from the wind. Exposure in a\nshallow pit would give about 90 percent pro-\ntection from gamma radiation from fallout\nparticles on the surrounding ground.\n\u2022 Niacin and Calcium\nNiacin deficiency causes pellagra, a disease that\nresults in weakness, a rash on skin exposed to the\nsun, severe diarrhea, and mental deterioration. If a\ntypical modern American had a diet primarily of\ncorn and lacked the foods that normally supply\nniacin, symptoms of pellagra would first appear in\nabout 6 months. Since corn is by far our largest\ncrop-the U.S. production in 1985 was about 425\nbillion pounds-theskillful treatment of corn would\nbe important to post-attack survival and recovery.\nDuring the first part of this century, pellagra\nkilled thousands of Americans in the South each\nyear. These people had cornfor their principalstaple\nand ate few animal protein foods or beans. Yet","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":93,"content":"Mexicans, who eat even more corn than did those\nSoutherners-and have even fewer foods of animal\norigin-do not suffer from pellagra.\nThe Mexicans\u0027 freedom from pellagra is mainly\ndue to their traditional method of soaking and\nboiling their dried corn in a lime-water solution.\nThey use either dry, unslaked lime (calcium oxide, a\ndangerously corrosive substance made by roasting\nlimestone) or dry, slaked lime (calcium hydroxide,\nmade by adding water to unslaked lime). Dry lime\nweighing about I% as much as the dry corn isadded\nto the soak water, producing an alkaline solution.\nWood ashes also can be used instead of lime to make\nan alkali solution. Thealkalitreatment of corn makes\nthe niacin available to the human body..Tables 9.1\nand 9.2 show corn as having adequate niacin.\nHowever, the niacin in dried corn is not readily\navailable to the body unless the corn has received\nan alkali treatment.\nTreating corn with lime has another nutritional\nadvantage: the low calcium content of corn issignifi-\ncantly increased.\n\u2022 Fat\nThe emergency recommendation for fat is\nslightly over I ounce per day (30 g) of fat or cooking\noil. This amount of fat provides only 10% of the\ncalories in the emergency diet, which does not specify\na greater amount because fats would be in very short\nsupply after a nuclearattack. This amount isvery low\nwhen compared to the average diet eaten in this\ncountry, in which fat provides about 40% of the\ncalories. It would be difficult for many Americans to\nconsume sufficient calories to maintain normal\nweight and morale without a higher fat intake; more\nfat should be made available as soon as possible.\nIncreased fat intake is especially importantfor young\nchildren, to provide calories needed for normal\ngrowth and development. Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory field tests have shown that toddlers and\nold people, especially, prefer considerably more oil\nadded to grain mush than the emergency recom-\nmendation of 10%.\n\u2022 Vitamin 8-12 and Animal Protein\nVitamin 8-12 isthe only essential nutrient that is\navailable in nature solely from animal sources. Since\na normal person has a 2 to 4-year supply of vitamin\n8-12 stored in his liver, a deficiency should not\ndevelop before enough food of animal origin would\nagain be available.\nMany adults who are strict vegetarians keep\nin good health for years without any animal sources\nof food by using grains and beans together. It is\nmore difficult to maintain normal growth and\ndevelopment in young children on vegetarian diets.\nWhen sufficient animal sources of food areavailable,\nenough should be provided to supply 7 grams of\nanimal protein daily. This could be provided by\nabout 1.4ounces (38 g) of lean meat, 0.7 ounce (20 g)\nof nonfat dry milk, or one medium-sized egg. When\nsupplies are limited, young children should be given\npriority. Again: a little of these high-grade supple-\nmentary protein foods should be eaten with every\nmeal.\n\u2022 Iron\nMost people live out their lives without benefit\nof an iron supplement. However, many pregnant\nand nursing women and some children need\nsupplemental iron to prevent anemia. One tested\nexpedient way to make more iron available is to use\niron pots and pans, especially for cooking acid foods\nsuch as tomatoes. Another is to place plain iron nails\n(not galvanized nails) in vinegar until small amounts\nof iron beginto float to the surface. Thisusuallytakes\n2 to 4 weeks. Then a teaspoon of iron-vinegar\nsolution will contain about 30 to 60 mg of iron,\nenough for a daily supplement. The emergency\nrecommendation is 10mg per day. A teaspoon of the\niron-vinegar solution is best taken in a glass of water.\nThe iron content of fruit, such as an apple, can be\nincreased by placing iron nails in it for a few days.\nFOOD RESERVES\nRussia, China, and other countries that make\nserious preparations to survive disasters store large\nquantities offood-primarilygrain-both infarming\nareas and- near population centers. In contrast, the\nusually large U.S. stocks of grain and soybeans are\nan unplanned survival resource resulting from the\nproduction of more food than Americans can eat or\nsell abroad. The high productivity of U.S. agriculture\nis another unplanned survival asset. Providing\nenough calories and other essential nutrients for\n100 million surviving Americans would necessitate\nthe annual raising of only about 12% of our 1985\ncrop ofcorn, wheat, grain sorghum, and soybeans\n- if nothing else were produced. In 1985, the U.S.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":94,"content":"production of corn, wheat, soybeans, and grain\nsorghum totalled about 625 billion pounds -\nabout 7 pounds per day for one year for every\nAmerican. A total of 2 pounds per person per day of\nthese basic staples, in the proportions shown in Table\n9.2, would be sufficient to provide the essentials of an\nadequate vegetarian diet weighing about 27 ounces.\n(Grain sorghum is not listed in Table 9.2; it has\napproximately the same food value as corn.) The\nremaining 5ounces of the 2 pounds would feed enough\nchickens to meet a survivor\u0027s minimum long-term re-\nquirement for animal protein.\nIf corn, wheat, grain sorghum, and soybeans were\nthe only crops raised, the annual production would need\nto beonly739 poundsperperson. Our 1985annual\nproduction would have supplied every adult,\nchild, and infant in a population of 100 million\nwith 6250 pounds of these four staples..This is\nmore than 8 times enough to maintain good\nnutrition by Chinese standards.\nRecovery from a massive nuclear attack would\ndepend largelyon sufficientfood reservesbeingavailable\nto enable survivors to concentrate on restoring the\nessentials of mechanized farming. Enough housing\nwould remain intact or could be built to provide\nadequate shelter for the first few crucial years; enough\nclothing and fabrics would be available. But ifsurvivors\nwere forced by hunger to expend their energies at-\ntempting primitive subsistence farming, many deaths\nfrom starvation would occur and the prospects for\nnational recovery would be greatly reduced.\nAmericans\u0027 greatestsurvivalassetattheend\nof 1985 was about 17 billion bushels (about 850\nbillion pounds) of wheat, corn, grain sorghums,\nand soybeans in storage, mostly on farms. If200\nmillion Americans were to survive a limited\nnuclear attack and if only half of this stored food\nreserve could be delivered to the needy, each\nsurvivor would have adequate food for over 3\nyears, by Chinese nutritional standards.\nIn view of the crucial importance of large food\nreserves to the prospects for individual and national\nsurvival, it is to be hoped that U.S. food surpluses and\nlarge annual carry-overs willcontinue.\nA BASIC SURVIVAL RAnON TO STORE\nArationcomposed ofthe basicfoods listedbelowin\nTable 9.3 provides about 2600 calories per day and is\nnutritionally balanced. It keeps better than a ration of\ntypical Americanfoods, requires much lessspaceto store\nor transport, and ismuch lessexpensive. The authorand\nsome friends have stored enough of these basic foods to\nlast their families several months during a crisis, and\nhave eaten large quantities of these foods with satis-\nfaction over the past 20 years. (A different emergency\nration should be stored for infants and very small\nchildren, as will be explained in the following section.)\nField tests have indicated thatthe majority of Americans\nwould find these basic foods acceptable under crisis\nconditions. In normal times, however, no one should\nstore this or any otheremergencyfood supplyuntil after\nhe has prepared, eaten, and found its components\nsatisfactory.\nUnprocessed grains and beans provide adequate\nnourishment for many millions of the world\u0027s people\nwho have littleelseto eat. Dry grains and beans are very\ncompact: a 5-gallon can holds about 38 pounds of hard\nwheat. Yetwhencooked,dry wholegrains become bulky\nand givea well-fedfeeling - a distinct advantage ifit is\nnecessary to go on short rations during a prolonged\ncnsis.\nThis basic ration has two disadvantages: (I) it\nrequires cooking, and (2) Americans are un-\naccustomed to such a diet. Cooking difficulties can\nbe minimized by having a grain-grinding device, a\nTable 9.3.

The disadvantage of\nstarting to eat unaccustomed foods at a stressful\ntime can be lessened by eating more whole grains\nand beans in normal times-thereby, incidentally,\nsaving money and improving a typical American\ndiet by reducing fat and increasing bulk and fiber.\nWhen storing enough of this ration to last for\nseveral months or a year, it is best to select several\nkinds of beans for variety and improved nutrition.\nIf soybeans are included, take into account the dif-\nferences between soybeans and common beans, as\nnoted earlier in this chapter.\nIn many areas it is difficult to buy wheat and\nbeans at prices nearly as low as the farmer receives\nfor these commodities. However, in an increasing\nnumber of communities, at least one store sells\nwhole-grain wheat and beans in large sacks at\nreasonable prices. Mormons, who store food for a\nrange of possible personal and national disasters, are\noften the best sources of information about where\nto get basic foods in quantity, at reasonable cost.\nSoon after purchase, bulk foods should be removed\nfrom sacks (but not necessarily from sealed-plastic\nliner-bags) and sealed in metal containers or in\nthick-walled plastic containersfor storage. Especially\nin the more humid parts of the United States, grain\nand beans should befrequently checked for moisture.\nIf necessary, these foods should be dried out and\nrid of insects as described later in this chapter.\nVegetable oil stores as well in plastic bottles as\nin glass ones. The toughness and lightness of plastic\nbottles make them better than glass for carrying\nwhen evacuating or for using in a shelter. Since a\npound ofoil provides about 21/4times as muchenergy\nas does a pound of sugar, dry grain, or milk powder,\nstoring additional vegetable oil is an efficient way\nto improve a grain diet and make it more like the\n40o/c-fat diet of typical Americans.\nAll multivitamin pills providing 5000 Inter-\nnational Units (1500 mg retinol equivalent) vitamin\nA, 400 IV (10 mg) of vitamin 0, and 50 to 100 mg\nof vitamin C, must meet U.S. Governmentstandards,\nso the least expensive usually are quite adequate.\nStorage in a refrigerator greatly lengthens the time\nbefore vitamin pills must be replaced with fresh\nones. Because vitamin C is so essential, yet very\ninexpensive and long-lasting, it is prudent to store\na large bottle.\nIt would be wise to have on hand ready-to-eat,\ncompact foods for use during a week or two in a\nshelter, in addition to those normally kept in the\nkitchen. It is not necessary to buy expensive\u0022survival\nfoods\u0022 or the special dehydrated foods carried by\nmany backpackers. All large food stores sell the\nfollowing concentrated foods: non-fat milk powder,\ncanned peanuts, compact ready-to-eat dry cereals\nsuch as Grape Nuts, canned meat and fish, white\nsugar, vegetable oil in plastic bottles, iodized salt,\nand daily multivitamin pills. If shelter occupants\nhave a way to boil water(seeFigs. 9.2 and 9.3, Bucket\nStove), it isadvisable to include rice, noodles, and an\n\u0022instant\u0022 cooked cereal such as oatmeal or\nwheat-along with coffee and tea for those who\nhabitually drink these beverages.\nParched grain is a ready-to-eat food that has\nbeen used for thousands of years. Whole-kernel\nwheat, corn, and rice can be parched by the following\nmethod: Place the kernels about 1/4-inch deep in a\npan, a skillet, or a tin can while shaking it over a\nflame, hot coals, or a\u0027 red hot electric burner. The\nkernels will puff and brown slightly when parched.\nThese parchedgrainsare notdifficult to chewand can\nbe pounded to a meal more easily than can the raw\nkernels. Parched grain-stores well ifkept dry and free\nof insects.\nEMERGENCY FOOD FOR BABIES\nInfants and very small children would be the\nfirst victims of starvation after a heavy nuclear\nattack, unless special preparations are made on their\nbehalf. Our huge stocks of unprocessed foods, which\ncould prevent the majority of unprepared survivors\nfrom dying of hunger, would not be suitable for the\nvery young. They need foods that are more con-\ncentrated and less rough. Most American mothers do\nnot nurse their infants, and if a family\u0027s supply of\nbaby foods were exhausted the parents might ex-\nperience the agony of seeing their baby slowly\nstarve.\nFew Americans have watched babies starving.\nIn China, I saw anguish on starving mothers\u0027 faces\nas they patted and squeezed their flat breasts, trying\nto get a little more milk into their weak babies\u0027\nmouths.

I believe that parents who fear\nthe use of nuclear weapons will be glad to bear the\nsmall expense of keeping on hand the emergency\nbaby foods listed in Table 9.4, below. (More de-\ntailed descriptions of these and many other foods,\nwith instructions for their use, are given in an Oak\nRidge National Laboratory report, Maintaining\nNutritional Adequacy During A Prolonged Food\nCrisis, ORNL-5352, 1979. This report may be\npurchased for $6.50 from National Technical In-\nformation Service, U.S. Department of Commerce,\n5385 Port Royal Road, Springfield, Virginia 22161.)\nTo make a formula adequate for a 24-hour\nperiod, the quantities of instant non-fat dry milk,\nvegetable cooking oil, and sugar listed in the \u0022Per\nDay\u0022 column of Table 9.4 should be added to 4 cups\nof safe water. This formula can be prepared daily in\ncool weather or when a refrigerator is available.\nIn warm or hot weather, or under unsanitary con-\nditions, it is safer to make a formula 3 times a day.\nTo do so, add ]/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons (a little less\nthan one ounce) of instant non-fat milk powder\nto I]) cups (3 pint) of boiled water, and stir\nthoroughly. Then add 1tablespoon (about ]/3 ounce,\nor 9 grams) of vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of sugar,\nand stir. (If regular bakers\u0027 milk powder is used, ]/4\ncup is enough when making one-third -of the daily\nformula, 3 times a day.) If baby bottles are not at\nhand. milk can be spoon-fed to an infant.\nEspecially during a war crisis, the best and\nmost dependable food for an infant is mother\u0027s\nmilk--provided the mother is assured an adequate\ndiet. The possibility of disaster is one more reason\nwhy a mother should nurse her baby for a full year.\nStoring additional high-protein foods and fats for\na nursing mother usually will be better insurance\nagainst her infant getting sick or starving than\nkeeping adequate stocks of baby foods and the\nequipment necessary for sanitary feeding after\nevacuation or an attack.\nTo give a daily vitamin supplement to a baby, a\nmultivitamin pill should be crushed to a fine powder\nbetween two spoons and dissolved in a small amount\nof fluid, so that the baby can easily swallow it. If an\ninfant does not receive adequate amounts of vitamins\nA, D, and C, he will develop deficiency symptoms\nin I to 3 months, depending on the amounts stored\nin his body. Vitamin C deficiency, the first to appear,\ncan be.prevented by giving an infant 15 mg of\nvitamin C each day (about ]/3 of a 50-mg vitamin C\ntablet, pulverized) or customary foods containing\nvitamin C, such as orange juice. Lacking these\nsources, the juice squeezed from sprouted grains\nor legumes can be used. If no vitamin pills or foods\nrich in vitamin D are available, exposure of the\nbaby\u0027s skin to sunlight will cause his bodyto produce\nvitamin D. It would be wise to wait about 30 days\nafter an attack before exposing the baby to sunlight.\nAfter that, short exposures would be safe except\nin areas of extremely heavy fallout. As a further\nprecaution, the baby can be placed in an open,\nshallow pit that will provide shielding from radiation\ngiven off by fallout particles on the ground. Initial\nexposure should be very short, no more than\n10 minutes.\nIf sufficient milk is not obtainable, even infants\nyounger than six months should be given solid food.\nSolid foods for babies must be pureed to a fine\nTable 9.4.

Using a modern baby food grinder makes\npureeing quick and easy work. Under crisis con-\nditions, a grinder should be cleaned and disinfected\nlike other baby-feeding utensils, as described later in\nthis section.\nSeveral expedient methods are available: the\nfood can be pressed through a\u0027 sieve, mashed with\na fork or spoon, or squeezed through a porous cloth.\nGood sanitation must be maintained; all foods\nshould be brought to a boil after pureeing to insure\nthat the food is safe from bacteria.\nA pureed solid baby food can be made by first\nboiling together ~ parts of a cereal grain and I part\nof beans until they are soft. Then the mixture should\nbe pressed through a sieve. The sieve catches the\ntough hulls from the grain kernels and the skins\nfrom the beans. The grain-beans combination will\nprovide needed calories and a well-supplemented\nprotein. The beans also supply the additional iron\nthat a baby needs by the time he is 6 months old.\nFlours made from whole grains or beans, as pre-\nviously described, also can be used; however, these\nmay contain more rough material.\nSome grains are preferable to others. It iseasier\nto sieve cooked corn kernels than cooked wheat\nkernels. Since wheat is the grain most likely to cause\nallergies, it should not be fed to an infant until he\nis 6 to 7 months old if other grains, such as \u0027rice or\ncorn, are available.\nSmall children also need more protein than can\nbe supplied by grains alone. As a substitute for milk,\nsome bean food should be provided at every meal. If\nthe available diet isdeficient inaconcentratedenergy\nsource such as fat or sugar, a child\u0027s feedings should\nbe increased to 4 or 5 times a day, to enable him to\nassimilate more. Whenever possible, a small child\nshould have a daily diet that contains at least one\nounce of fat (3 tablespoons, without scraping the\nspoon). This would provide more than 10% of a\nyoung child\u0027s calories in the form offat, which would\nbe beneficial.\nIf under emergency conditions it is not practical\nto boil infant feeding utensils, they can be sterilized\nwith a bleach solution. Add one teaspoon of ordinary\nhousehold bleach to a quart of water. (Ordinary\nhousehold bleach contains 5.25% sodium hypo-\nchlorite as its only active ingredient and supplies\napproximately 5% available chlorine. If the strength\nof the bleach isunknown, add 3teaspoons per quart.)\nDirections for safe feeding without boiling follow:\nThe Utensils (Include at least one I-quart and one\nI-pint mason jar, for keeping prepared\nformula sterile until used.)\nI.

Prepare fresh chlorine solution each day.\nSTORAGE OF FOODS\nWhole grains and white sugar can be stored\nsuccessfully for decades; dried beans, non-fat milk\npowder, and vegetable oil can be stored for several\nyears. Some rules for good storage follow:\n\u2022 Keep food dry. The most dependable way to\nassure continuing dryness is to store dry grain in\nmetal containers, such as ordinary 5-gallon metal\nstorage cans or 55-gallon metal drums with gasketed\nlids. Filled 5-gallon cans are light enough to be easily\ncarried in an automobile when evacuating.\nParticularly in humid areas, grain which seems\nto be dry often is not dry enough to store for a long\nperiod. To be sure that grain is dry enough to store\nfor years, use a drying agent. The best drying agent\nfor this purpose is silica gel with color indicator.\nThe gel is blue when it is capable of absorbing water\nand pink when it needs to be heated to become an","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":98,"content":"effective drying agent again. Silica gel is inexpensive if\nboughtfrom chemical supply firms located in most cities.\nByheating it in a hot oven or in a can over a fireuntil it\nturns blue again, silica gel can be used repeatedly for\nyears.\nThe best containers for the silica gel used to dry\ngrain (or to determine its dryness) are homemade cloth\nenvelopes large enough for a heapingcupful ofthe gel.A\nclear plastic window should be stitched in, through\nwhich color changes can be observed. Put an evelope of\nsilica gel on top of the grain in a 5-gallon can filled to\nwithin a couple of inches of its top. Then close the can\ntightly. Even a rather loose-fitting lid can be sealed\ntightly with tape. If after a few days the silica gel is still\nblue, the grain isdry enough. Ifthe silica gel has turned\npink, repeat the process with fresh envelopes until it can\nbe seen that the grain is dry.\n\u2022 Keep grains and beans free of weevils, other insects,\nand rodents. Dry ice(carbondioxide) isthe safest means\u00B7\nstill widely available to the public for ridding grain and\nbeans of insects. Place about4inches ofdry iceon top of\nthe grain in a 5-gallon metal container. Put the lid on\nsomewhat loosely, so that air in the grain can be driven\nout of the can. (This willhappen as the dry icevaporizes\nand the heavycarbondioxidegassinks into the grain and\ndisplaces the air around the kernels.) After an hour or\ntwo, tighten the lid and seal it with tape. After one\nmonth,all insects inthiscarbon-dioxideatmosphere will\nhave died from lack of oxygen.\n\u2022 Store foods in the coolest available place, out of the\nlight. Rememberthatthe storage lifeof most foods iscut\nin half by an increase of 18\u00B0F (10\u00B0C) in storage\ntemperature.v Thus 48 months of storage at 52\u00B0F is\nequivalent to 24 months at 70\u00B0F, and to 12months at\n88\u00B0F.\nIllustrative ofthe importance ofcool storageare my\nexperiences in storing non-fat milk powder in an earth-\ncovered, cool shelter. In steel drums I stored unopened\nlOO-pound bags of compact, non-fat milk powder that I\nbought from bakeries. The cost per pound wasmuch less\nthan I would have paid for the largest packages sold in\nsupermarkets. After 7 years storage at temperatures of\nabout 50\u00B0F the year around, my milk powder was still\ngood ~ as good as it would have been if stored in a\nnormally air-conditioned and heated home for about 3\nyears.\n\u2022 Do not place stored metal containers directly on the\nfloor. To avoid possible condensation of moisture and\nthe rusting that results, place containers on spaced\nboards. For long-term storage in damp permanent\nshelters or damp basements, use solid-plasticcontainers\nwith thick walls.\n\u2022 Rotate stored foods. Eat the oldest food of each type\nand replace it with fresh food. Althoughcookingoiland\nnon-fat milk powder remain edible after several years of\nstorage at room temperature, these and most other dry\nfoods are more nourishing and taste better if stored for\nno more than 2years. Most canned foods taste better if\nkept no more thanone year. Exceptionsare whole grains\nand white sugar, which stay good for decades if stored\nproperly.\n\u2022 Storeplentyofsalt.Inourmodernworldsaltis\nso abundant and cheap that most Americans do\nnot realize that in many areas soon after a major\nnuclear attack salt would become a hard-to-get\nessentialnutrient.Personsworkinghardwithout\nsalt would suffer cramps and feel exhausted\nwithin a few days.

Only\nan accurate, dependable fallout meter will enable\nsurvivors to answer these life-or-death questions\u0027.\nGamma radiation is by far the most dan-\ngerous radiation given off by fallout particles.\nGamma rays are like X rays, only more pene-\ntratingandharmful.Theroentgen(R) istheunit\nmost commonly used to measure exposures to\ngamma rays, or to X rays, and most American\ncivil defense instruments give readings in\nroentgens (R) or roentgens per hour (R/hr).\nTherefore, for simplicity\u0027s sake, in this book\nalmostallradiationdoses are given inroentgens\n(R), and radiation dose rates are given in\nroentgens per hour (R/hr). This simplification\nis justified because, for external whole-body\ngamma radiation from fallout, the numerical\nvalueofanexposure ordose given in roentgens\nis approximately the same. as the numerical\nvalue-given in rems or rads. (For information\non the rem and the rad, and on the seriousness\nand probability of injuries likely to be suffered\nas a result of receiving different sized doses of\ngamma radiation, see \u0022Lifetime Risks from\nRadiation\u0022, a section of Chapter 13.)\nThe dose (the quantity) of radiation that a\nperson receives, along with the length of time\nduring which the dose is received, determine\nwhat injuries, if any, will be suffered as a result\nof the dose.

Under nuclear war conditions,\nreceiving an occasional dose of lR (1,000 milli-\nroentgens) would be of little concern, as ex-\nplained in Chapter 13 and 18.\nWARNINGS FOR BUYERS OF\nFALLOUT METERS\nYou are \u0022on your own\u0022 when buying a dose\nrate meter or dosimeter because:\n\u2022 No U.S. Government agency or other Gov-\nernment facility advises the public regarding\nsources of the best available radiation-measur-\ninginstrumentsfor use in timeofwar, orwarns\nconcerned individuals that certain instruments\nare either incapable of measuring adequately\nhigh dose rates or doses for wartime use, or are\ndangerously inaccurate. For example, a dose\nrate meter that in 1982 sold nationwide was\ntestedinthatyearatOakRidge NationalLabora-\ntory to determine its accuracy for measuring\ngamma radiation. This instrument was reason-\nably accurate at low dose rates, but at the high\ndose rates of life or death importance in a\nnuclearwar its readings weredangerouslylow:\nWhen it should have read 150 R/hr, it read 13.9\nR/hr. Another dose rate meter of this same\nmodel, tested in CaliforniabyDr. BruceClayton,\nread only 16 R/hr when it should have read 400\nR/hr. Obviously, if this model were used and\ntrustedby a persondoingrescue workfor hours\noutdoors in heavy fallout, while believing that\nhe was receiving a non-incapacitating dose he\nactually would be getting a fatal dose!\n\u2022 Instrumentsthatmeasureonlymilliroentgen-\nrange dose rates are sold for war use by some\ncompanies. Since mostAmericanshaveno idea\nwhat size of radiation doses would incapacitate\nor kill them, and do not even know that a\nmilliroentgen is 1/1000 of a roentgen, some\npeople buy instruments that are capable of\nmeasuring maximum dose rates of only one\nroentgen or less per hour. For example, an\nAmerican company advertised and sold for\n$370.00 in 1986 its dose rate meter that has a\nmaximum range of \u00220 - 1000 mR/hr.\u0022 It is the\nonlydose rate meterin thatcompany\u0027slistingof\n\u0022Radiation Detection Products for the General\nPublic\u0022, described as\u0022 ... applicable for use in\ncase of nuclear war.\u0022 The highest dose rate that\nitcan measure, one roentgen per hour, is far too\nlow to be of much use in a nuclear war.\n\u2022 Used and surplus dose rate meters and dosi-\nmeters are likely to be inaccurate or otherwise\nunreliable. Very few buyers have access to a\nradiation source powerful enough to check in-\nstrumentsfor accuracyovertheirfull rangesof\nmeasurements.Myeducationregardingbargain\nfallout meters began in 1961, after I bought two\ndosimeters of a model then beingproduced by a\nleadingmanufacturingcompanyand purchased\nin quantity by the Office of Civil Defense.\nWithina weekafterreceivingtheseinstruments,\none ofthemcouldnotbe charged. The otherwas\nfound to be inaccuate.

To\ndo so would reduce the chances of this book\nbeing distributed or advocated by Government\nagencies.\nWAR RESERVES OF FALLOUT METERS\nOne of Americans\u0027 most important assets\nfor surviving a\u0027 nuclear war is the Federal\nEmergency Management Agency\u0027s (FEMA\u0027s)\nsupply of fallout meters. These instruments\ninclude approximately 600,000 dose rate meters\nand about 3,300,000 dosimeters, all suitable for\nwartime use. In 1986 almost all of these old\ninstruments-thatcanbe found-reportedlystill\nare in good working condition. Because ofcon-\ntinuing inadequate funding for civil defense, in\n. recent years most of FEMA\u0027s instruments have\nbeen serviced, calibrated, and, if necessary,\nrepaired only once every four years. In a few\nlocalitiestheseinstrumentsareno longerbeing\nserviced.\nMost of these critically important instru-\nments are keptin cities,in buildings likelyto be\ndestroyed by blast or fire in the event of a\nmassive Soviet attack. If there were a suffi-\nciently long, officially recognized period of\nwarning before an attack, it might be possible\nduring such a worsening crisis to move a large\nfraction of thesefallout metersoutsidethe areas\nof probable blast or fire damage, and to place\nthem in officially designated fallout shelters.\nHowever, this unlikely development would not\nprovide private family shelters with instru-\nments.\nMostfamilies needtheirownfallout meters.\nThis need is greatest for families living in","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":102,"content":"localitiesnotlikelytobedamagedbyblastorfire,\nand for those planning to evacuate to such less\nhazardous localities during a worsening crisis.\nCOMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE\nFALLOUT METERS\nIn 1987 an American does not have many\nchoices if he wants to buy an off-the-shelf dose\nrate meter suitable for measuring the high\nlevelsoffallout radiationthat wouldresultfrom\na nuclear attack. Although inexpensive dose\nrate meters and dosimeters have been under\ndevelopment by the military services and civil\ndefense researchers for the past 15 years, they\nhave not been produced commercially for sale\nto the public.

It is sold\nin the United States by a subsidiary, Alnor\nNuclear,2585 WashingtonRoad, Suite 120, Pitts-\nburg, Pennsylvania 15241. In 1988 the FOB-\nprice, pre-paid, is$1,100.00. TheRD-l0accurate-\nly measures gamma and X raysfrom veryclose\nto natural background radiation up to 300 R/hr,\nin two ranges (0.03 - 300 mR/hr, and 0.03 - 300\nR/hr). It meets Finnish Army standards for\nruggedness and accurate operation in sub-zero\ncold (down to -25\u00B0C, or -13\u00B0F); it has an illumi-\nnated scale for night use and an audible pulse\nrate signal, and is built to withstand electro-\nmagnetic pulse (EMP) effects. (A few of my\nfriends and I for years have owned Finnish\ninstruments of an earlier model, the RD-8; they\nstill are in excellent working condition.)\nA less expensive dose rate meter designed\nfor ruggedwartimeuseisthe Portable Radiolog-\nicalDoseRate MeterPDRM82, manufacturedin\nEngland by Plessey Controls Limited, Sopers\nLane, Poole, Dorset BH17 7ER, England.

(Like all instru-\nments, occasionally a PDRM 82 does fail. One\nbought by a friend in 1987 and tested by a radia-\ntion laboratory in Utah read 86 centigrays per\nhour when it should have read 300, and failed to\ndisplay\u0022FAIL.\u0022 Mailedbackto England,Plessey\nControls finally replaced it with another new\nPDRM82.)Theonlyconsequentialdisadvantages\nof the PDRM 82, compared to more expensive\ndose rate meters, are that it reads in centigrays\nper hour (cGy/hr is equivalent to Rads/hr, or\nR/hr)anddoes notmeasuredose rateslowerthan\n0.1 cGy/hr (100 mR/hr). In 1987 this portable,\nfour-digit-liquid-display dose rate meteris sold\nby Plessey Controls for 250 Brrtish pounds plus\nair shipment charges - all pre-paid.

Higher priority work\nwould be the building of a high-protection-factor\nshelter, the making of a shelter-ventilating pump, and\nthe storing ofadequate water. In a crisisitmight not be\npossible to obtain some needed materials for a KFM.\nIt is very difficult to concentrate on unfamiliar\ndetails during a nerve-racking crisis, or to do delicate\nwork with hands that may become unsteady. The best\ntime to build and learn to use a KFM is in peacetime,\nlong before a crisis. Then this long-lasting instrument\nshould be stored for possible future need.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":106,"content":"Chapter 11\nLight\nTHE NEED FOR MINIMUM LIGHT\nNumerous disasters have proved that many\npeople can remain calm for several days in total\ndarkness.

It iseasy to\nimagine the impact of a few hysterical people on the\nother occupants of a pitch-dark shelter. Under\nwartime conditions, evena faint light that shows only\nthe shapes of nearby people and things can make the\ndifference between an endurable situation and a\nblack ordeal.\nFigure 11.1 shows what members of the Utah\nfamily saw in their shelter on the third night of\noccupancy.

During a crisis you should give higher\npriority to many other needs.\nThings to remember about using small bulbs\nwith big batteries:\n\u2022 Always use a bulb of the same voltage as the\nbattery.\n\u2022 Use a small, high-resistance wire, such as bell\nwire, with a car ~attery.\n\u2022 Connect the battery after the rest of the\nimprovised light circuit has been completed.\n\u2022 Use reflective material such as aluminum foil,\nmirrors, or white boards to concentrate a weak light\nwhere it is needed.\n\u2022 If preparations are made before a crisis, small\n12-volt bulbs (0.1 to 0.25 amps) with socketsand wire\ncan be bought at a radio partsstore. Electric test clips\nfor connecting thin wire to a car battery can be\npurchased at an auto parts store.\nCANDLES AND COMMERCIAL LAMPS\nPersons going to a shelter should take all their\ncandles with them, along with plenty of matches in a\nwaterproof container such as a Mason jar. Fully\noccupied shelters can become so humid that matches\nnot kept in moisture-proof containers cannot be\nlighted after a single day.\nLighted candles and other fires should be placed\nnear the shelter opening through which air is leaving\nthe shelter, to avoid buildup of slight amounts of\ncarbon monoxide and other headache-causinggases.\nIf the shelter is completely closed fora time for any\nreason, such as to keep out smoke from a burning\nhouse nearby, all candlesand otherfires inthe shelter\nshould be extinguished.\nGasoline and kerosene lamps should not be\ntaken inside a shelter. They produce gases that can\ncause headaches or even death. If gasoline or\nkerosene lamps are knocked over, as by blast winds\nthat would rush into sheltersoverextensiveareas, the\nresults would be disastrous.\nSAFE EXPEDIENT LAMPS FOR SHELTERS\nThe simple expedient lamps described below are\nthe results of Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nexperiments which started withoil lamps of the kinds\nused by Eskimos and the ancient Greeks. Our\nobjective was to develop safe, dependable, long-\nlasting shelter lights that can be made quickly, using\nonly common household materials. Numerous field\ntests have proved that average Americans can build\ngood lamps byfollowing the instructions given below\n(Fig. 11.2).\nThese expedient lamps have the following\nadvantages:\n\u2022 They are safe. Even ifa burning lamp isknocked\nover onto a dry paper, the flame issosmallthat itwill\nbe extinguished if the lamp fuel being burned is a\ncooking oil or fat commonly used in the kitchen, and\nif the lamp wick is not much larger than 1/16 inch in\ndiameter.\n\u2022 Since the flame isinside ajar, it isnot likely to set\nfire to a careless person\u0027s clothing or to be blown out\nby a breeze.\n\u2022 With the smallest practical wick and flame, a\nlamp burns only about I ounce of edible oil or fat in\neight hours.\n\u2022 Even with a flame smallerthanthat ofa birthday\ncandle, there is enough light for reading. To read\neasily by such a small flame, attach aluminum foil to\nthree sides and the bottom of the lamp, and suspend it\nbetween you and your book, just high enough not to\nblock your vision.

If\nmodern medical facilities were temporarily unavail-\nable, the prevention of diseases would become much\nmore important to all of us.\nThe following infection-preventing measuresare\nsimple, practical, and require some self-discipline.\nThe author has observed their practice and has used\nthem while exploring and soldiering in a number of\njungle, desert, and mountain regions. Ialso have used\nthese measures while field-testing nuclear war\nsurvival skills in several states.\nBasic first aid also would be of increased\nimportance during a major confrontation or war.\u00B7\nGood first aid booklets and instructionsare available\nin practically all communities, so most first aid\ninformation will not be repeated here.\nDISPOSAL OF HUMAN WASTES\nTo preserve health and morale in a shelter\nwithout a toilet or special chemicals for treatment of\nexcrement and urine, human wastes should be\nremoved before they produce much gas. A garbage\ncan with a lid or a bucketcovered with plasticwillnot\nhold the pressurized gas produced by rotting\nexcrement. The following expedient means of\ndisposal are listed in increasingorder of effectiveness.\n\u2022 Use a 5-gallon paint can, a bucket, or a large\nwaterproof wastebasket to collect both urine and\nexcrement. Use and keep it near the air-exhaust end\nof the shelter. Keep it tightlycovered when not inuse;\na piece of plastic tied over the top keeps out insects\nand reduces odors. When such waste containers are\nfull or begin to stink badly while covered, put them\noutside the shelter-still covered to keep out flies.\nFor some people, especially the aged, bringing a\ntoilet seat from home would be justified. Padding on\nthe edge of the bucketalso helps those who have to sit\ndown. An improvised seat of plywood or board\nserves well.\nIf only one container is available and is almost\nfilled, periodically dump the wastes outside-unless\nfallout is still being deposited. Before an anticipated\nattack, people who plan to stay in a sheltershould dig\na waste-disposal pit if they do not have sufficient\nwaste containers for weeks of shelter occupancy. The\npit should be located about 3 feet from the shelter in\nthe down-wind direction. This usually will be the air\nexhaust end of an earth-covered shelter. The pit\nshould be surrounded by a ring of mounded, packed\nearth about 6 inches high, to keep surfacewater from\nheavy rains from running into it.\nQuickly putting or dumping wastes outside is\nnot hazardous once fallout is no longer being\ndeposited. For example, assume the shelter is in an\narea of heavy fallout and the dose rate outside is\n400 R/hr-enough to give a potentially fatal dose in\nabout an hour to a person exposed in the open. Ifa\nperson needs to be exposed for only 10 seconds to\ndump a bucket, in this 1/360th of an hour he will\nreceive a dose of only about I R. Under war condi-\ntions, an additional I-R dose isof little concern. Ifthe","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":110,"content":"shelter design does not permit an occupant to dispose\nof wastes without running outside, he can tie cloth or\nplastic over his shoes before going out, and remove\nthese coverings in the entry before going back inside\nthe shelter room. This precaution will eliminate the\nchance of tracking \u0022hot\u0022 fallout particles into the\nshelter, and the small chance of someone getting a\ntiny beta burn in this way.\n\u2022 Have all occupants only urinate in the bucket,\nand defecate into a piece of plastic. Urine contains\nfew harmful organisms and can be safely dumped\noutside.\nTwo thicknesses ofthe thin plastic used to cover\nfreshly drycleaned clothes will serve to hold bowel\nmovements of several persons. Gather the plastic\naround the excrement to form a bag-like container.\nTie the plastic closed near its upperedges with a string\nor narrow strip of cloth. Do not tie it so tightly as to\nbe gas-tight. Each. day\u0027s collection should be gently\ntossed outside. As the excrement rots, the gas will\nleak out of the tied end of the plastic covering. Flies\nwill be attracted in swarms, but they will not be able\nto get into the plastic to contaminate their feet or to\nlay eggs. And because rotting excrement is so\nattractive to flies, shelter occupants will be bothered\nless by these dangerous pests.\nIf you have prudently kept a can ofmodern\nfly bait in your survival supplies, a little\nsprinkled on top ofthe plastic covering can kill\nliterally thousands of flies. The most effective\nfly baits, such as Die Fly and Improved Golden\nMalrin, are sold in farm supply stores.\n.\u2022 Use a hose-vented, 5-gallon can or bucket lined\nwith a heavy plastic bag; cover tightly with plastic\nwhen not in use. Figure 12.1 shows this type of\nexpedient toilet.\nThe vent-hose runs through a hole near the top\nof the paint can shown and istaped to seal it to the\ncan. Such a hole can be quite easily cut with a chisel or\na sharpened screwdriver. The hose is long enough to\nextend outside the shelter. Its outer end should be\nsecured about 6 inches aboveground level, to prevent\nwater from running into it during a heavy rain. When\na toilet-can is tightly covered, foul gases can escape\nthrough the hose to the outdoors.\nWith its opening tied shut, a large plastic trash\nbag containing as much as 30pounds of wastes can be\nlifted out of a toilet-can and disposed of outside the\nshelter.\nThe 6-member Utah family described in preced-\ning chapters used a home-like expedient toiletduring\ntheir 77-hour shelter stay. Figure 12.2 pictures the\ntoilet seat they took with them, placed on a hose-\nFig. 12.1. A 5-gallon paint can used for a hose-\nvented toilet-can, with a plastic trash bag for its\nremovable liner.\nvented container in a hole in the ground. The toilet\nwas at one end ofthe shelter. A person sitting on this\ntoilet could put his feet in the adjacent \u0022stand-up\nhole\u0022 aoR be more comfortable.\nThe blanket shown hanging on the left in\nFig. 12.2 could be drawn in front of the toilet for\nprivacy. Behind the girl\u0027s head was the emergency\ncrawlway-ventilation trench. When the toilet was\nbeing used, the shelter-ventilating KAP pumped air\nunder the blanket-curtain and out the ventilation\ntrench, resulting in very little odor in the rest of the\nshelter.\nVomiting is certain to cause both morale and\nhealth problems, especially for unprepared shelter\noccupants fearing this first dramatic symptom of\nradiation sickness. Nervousness, combined with the\neffects of unaccustomed food and water, will cause\neven some healthy persons to vomit. In a crowded\nshelter, the sight and smell ofvomit will make others\nthrow up.

Buckets, pots, or a newspaper folded\ninto a cone also will serve.\nDISPOSAL OF DEAD BODIES\nIn large shelters which are occupied for many\ndays, someone may die even when no occupants have\nbeen injured by blast, fire, or radiation. The sight or\nthe sickly-sweet stink of a decaying human pody is\ngreatly disturbing. Some civil defense workers have\ntheorized that the best way to take care of a corpse in\na shelter until the fallout dose-rate outdoors is low\nenough to allow burial is to seal it in a large plastic\nbag. A simple test with a dead dog proved this idea\nimpractical: gas pressurecaused the bag to burst. One\nsolution is to put the corpse outside as soon as the\nodor is evident. First, if possible, place it in a bag\nmade of large plastic trash bags taped together and\nperforated with a few pinholes.\nCLEAN WATER AND FOOD\nDisinfecting water by boiling (preferably for at\nleast 10 minutes) or by treating it with chlorine or\niodine has been described in Chapter 8, Water.\nWhen water is first stored, it should be dis-\ninfected by the addition of I scant teaspoon of\nordinary household bleach for each 10 gallons.\nTo avoid contaminating water when removing\nsmall quantities from a container such as a\nwaterproofbag, the simplestway isfirst to pour some\ninto a pot or other medium-sized container, from\nwhich small amounts can be poured into individual\ncups. Dipping water with a cup runs more risk of\ncontamination. The cleanest way to take small\nquantities of water out of a container is to siphon it\nwith a flexible tube, as described in Chapter8, Water.\nSanitary storage of food in expedient shelters is\noften difficult. Although almost any paper or plastic\ncovering will keep fallout particles from food, shelter\ndampness can cause paper containers to break. Ants,\nroaches, and weevils can cut through paper or plastic\ncoverings to reach food inside. Placing paper\ncontainers offood in plastic bags and suspending the\nbags from the ceiling of the shelter entryway gives\ngood protection against bugs, and quitegood protec-\ntion against moisture for a few weeks. (Do not\nobstruct the air flow through an entryway if heat isa\nproblem.) A small amount of insect repellent or\ngrease smeared on the suspending string or wire will\nstop all crawlers. Metal and strong plastic containers\nwith tight lids protect food best.\nThe hygienic preparation and serving of food in\na shelter, especially in hot weather, require that all\ncooked food beeaten promptly. It isbest to eatwithin\nhalf-an-hour after cooking. Canned foods should be\nconsumed shortly after opening. The cleaning and\ndisinfecting of utensils, bowls, etc., should be done\npromptly, to prevent bacteria from multiplying and\nto lessen the chances of ants and other insects being\nattracted into the shelter. Sugarshould be mixed with\ncereals in the cooking pot, to avoid spilling.\nIn Oak Ridge National Laboratory shelter tests,\nonly a few infants and toddlers have been included\namong the occupants. Feeding infants and small\nchildren over a piece of plastic would be one good\nway to keep the inevitablespillagefrom complicating\nshelter life.\nTo avoid using dishes, most foods can be served\non squares of plastic. Spoons and such plastic","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":112,"content":"\u0022dishes\u0022 can be licked clean after eating. then\ndisinfected by boiling or by dipping them into\nchlorine bleach solution containing one tablespoon\nof Clorox-type bleach to a quart of water.\nA shelter occupant without a spoon can cat very\nthick grain mush in a sanitary manner by placing it on\na piece of plastic held in his hand. forming it into a\nball. and taking bites. Although Chinese peasants\noften eat wet-rice balls held in their bare hands.\nexperiments have indicated not unexpectedly\nthat Americans 00 not like to eat this way.\nCooking without oil or fat makes disinfecting\nutensils much easier when water and fuel arc being\nconserved. Cereals and sugar arc easy to wash off\nwith a little water. without soap.\nCONTROL OF INSECTS\nInsect sprays used in high-protection-factor\nshelters are likely \u0027to cause more problems than they\neliminate. Poisonous insecticides should be used with\ncaution. Insect repellents on the skin and clothing are\ngenerally helpful. but not likely to be in sufficient\nsupply to last for weeks or months. Some insect\nproblems and simple means ofcontrolling them are\ndescribed below.\nMosquitoes would multiply rapidly afteran attack.\nbecause normal control measures would not be in\neffect. Using insect screen or mosquito netting to cover\nthe ventilation openings of a shelter is the best way to\nkeep out mosquitoes. flies. and all larger insects. The\nlack of insect screening-when it would be too\nlateto obtain any-could resultin more harrass-\n. rnent, discomfort and possible disease than\nmost people accustomed to modern living are\nlikely to imagine. However. if the shelter has no air\npump. it is impractical to use screens that obstruct the\nfree movement ofvital air- except in cold weather.\nThe fly population would explode after a nuclear\nattack. Radiation doses several times larger than doses\nthat would kill people do not sterilize insects. In\nextensive rural areas where almost all people could\nhave adequate shelter to be safe from fallout. most\ndomestic animals and wild creatures would be killed.\nTrillions of flies would breed in the dead bodies.\nIf you have prudently kept a can of modern\nfly bait in your survival supplies. a little\nsprinkled on top of the plastic covering can kill\nliterally thousands of flies.\nShelter occupants should make every effort to\nprevent flies from reaching disease-spreading human\nwastes.\nAnts. especially in the warmer parts ofthe country.\ncould drive people out of expedient shelters. The best\nprevention isto try to find a shelter-building site that is\nnot near an ant nest. If shelter occupants are careful in\nstoring food and eating. ants arc less likely to becomea\nproblem.\nTicks and chiggers arc usually found on grass\nand low bushes. To avoid carrying these pests into the\nshelter. do not bring grass or dead leaves into your\nshelter for bedding except in freezing weather. Cut\nleafy branches high above the ground: few pests live\nin tall vegetation.\nPERSONAL POSSESSIONS\nToothbrushes are not boiled or otherwise dis-\ninfected after being used. because we all develop con-\nsiderable resistance to our own infective organisms.\nFor the same reason. each individual should have his\nown personal drinking cup. bowl. and spoon. They\nshould be cleaned as well as possible and kept covered\nwhen not in use.\nPREVENTION OF SKIN DISEASES\nIn crowded shelters. especially during hot\nweather. skin diseases are likely to be a more serious\nproblem than is generally recognized. The impor-\ntance of learning how to prevent skin diseases was\nmade apparent by one of the very few shelter-\noccupancy tests to be conducted in the summer\nwithout. air conditioning. This was a Navy test in\nwhich 99 men lived for 12 days in an underground\nshelter cooled only with outdoor summer air. I.\u0027 The\nincidence of skin complaints was high. even though\nmedical treatment was available on a daily basis. The\ntotal number of reports to sick call was 560: 34 of\nthese 99 healthy young men contracted heat rash and\n23 had other skin complaints such as fungus\ninfections. However. these. sailors lived in an\ninadequately ventilated shelter and did not cleanse\ntheir sweaty skins or use the other methods listed\nbelow for preventing skin troubles.\nEven in shelters that are skillfully ventilated with\nadequate outdoor air. skin diseases will be a serious\nproblem- especially in hot weather -unless special\nhygiene measures are followed. Humid heat and heat\nrash increase susceptibility to skin diseases. Most of\nthe following measures for preventing skin diseases\nhave been practiced by jungle natives for thousands\nof years.\n\u2022 Wash off sweat and dead skin. (When it is hot\nand humid. dead skin is continuously rubbing and\nflaking off and starting to decay.) Many jungle\nnatives rinse their bodies several times a day. Bathing\nseveral times a day with soap is harmful in humid\nheat; the rapid loss of normal skin oils is one of the\ncauses of skin diseases..Your skin can be kept fairly","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":113,"content":"clean by rinsing offeach day with just a cup ofwater,\nwhile rubbing gently with a very small cloth. A6-inch\nsquare of bedsheet cloth serves well. So that you can\ndispose of the dirty water afterwards, wash yourself\nwhile standing on a piece of plastic with itsedges held\nup slightly. (Place sticks or narrow boards under the\nedges.) Useabout two-thirds of the precious waterfor\nthe first rinse, starting from the face down and gently\nrubbing neck, armpits, stomach, groin, buttocks, and\nfeet with a washcloth. Then use the remaining water\nto rinse off again, using bare fingers. Ifboiling water\nis available, sterilize washcloths every day by boiling\nthem for a few minutes.\n\u2022 Sleep as cool and bare as practical, to dry the\nmaximum skin area.\n\u2022 If practical. sit and sleep only where other\nmembers of your family do and avoid use of bedding\nby more than one family.\n\u2022 Avoid infection from toilet seats by disinfecting\nwith a strong chlorine solution and then rinsing, by\ncovering with paper, or by not sitting down.\n\u2022 Wash or disinfect clothing as often as practical,\nespecially underwear and socks. Disinfecting cloth-\ning, not laundering it, is the most important health\nobjective under difficult shelter conditions. Dipping\nclothing into boiling water disinfects it. Unless plenty\nof water is available for rinsing, do not disinfect\nclothing by putting it in a chlorine bleach solution.\n\u2022 Wear shoes or sandals when walking about, to\nprevent fungus infections of the feet.\nRESPIRATORY DISEASES\nThe spread of respiratory and other diseases\ntransmitted by coughing and sneezing would be\ndifficult to control in long-occupied shelters.\nAdequate ventilation would help in disease preven-\ntion. In small shelters, it would be better if persons\nwho are sneezing or coughing could stay near the\nopening being used for air exhaust. In large shelters\nwith many occupants, the risk of one or moreofthem\nhaving a disease that iseasily spread obviously willbe\nhigher than in a small shelter.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":114,"content":"Chapter 13\nSurviving Without Doctors\nA TEMPORARY RETURN TO SELF-HELP\nMost doctors, hospital facilities, and medical\nsupplies are located in cities. An all-out attack would\ndestroy most of these modern blessings. Even if\nmedical assistance were nearby, only a few of the\nsurvivors confined to shelters inareas of heavy fallout\nwould be able to get needed medicines or the help ofa\ndoctor. For periods ranging from days to months,\nmost unprepared survivors would be forced to live\nunder medical conditionsalmostas primitiveas those\nexperienced by the majority of mankind for all but\nthe past few decades of human history.\nBENIGN NEGLECT\nLife without modern medical help would be less\npainful and hazardous for those survivors who have\nsome practical knowledge of what should be\ndone-or not done-under primitive, unsanitary\nconditions. Information about first aid and hygienic\nprecautions can be obtained from widely available\nRed Cross and civil defense booklets and courses,\nThis knowledge, with a stock of basic first aid\nsupplies, would reduce suffering and prevent ~any\ndangerous illnesses. However, first aid instructions\ndo not include advice about what to do for serious\ninjuries and sicknesses if no doctors or effective\nmedicines are available.\nWhere There Is No Doctor,\u0022 the excellent self-\nhelp handbook recommended by Volunteers in\nTechnical Assistance, gives much information that\ngoes far beyond the scope of first aid. But even this\nhandbook repeatedly recommends getting profes-\nsional medical help whenever possible for serious\ninjuries and illnesses.\nFortunately, the human body has remarkable\ncapabilities for healing itself, especially if the injured\nor sick personand hiscompanions practice intelligent\n\u0022benign neglect.\u0022 Such purposeful non-interference\nwith the body\u0027s recuperative processes was called\n\u0022masterful inactivity\u0022 by Colonel C. Blanchard\nHenry, M.D., a widely recognized authority on mass\ncasualty evacuation and treatment. Colonel Henry\nwas one of the first medical officers to visit Hiroshima\nand Nagasaki after their destruction and was an\nexperienced analyzer of civil defense preparations in\nseveral countries.\nThe following is a brief summary of\nColonel Henry\u0027s medical advice for nuclear war\nsurvivors living under primitive conditions and\nunable to get- the help of a doctor or effective\nmedicines.33 (Additionaladvice, enclosed inbrackets,\nis from a medical publication.\u0022)\n\u2022 Wounds: Apply only pressure dressings to stop\nbleeding-unless an artery has been cut, as bya blast-\nhurled piece of glass. If blood is spurting from a\nwound, apply both a pressure dressing a~d a\nwindlass-type. tourniquet. Loosen the tourrnquet\npressure about every 15 minutes, to allow enough\nblood to reach the flesh beyond the tourniquet and\nkeep it alive. There isa fair chance that clotting und~r\nthe pressure dressing will stop blood loss before It\nbecomes fatal.\n\u2022 Infected wounds: Do not change dressings\nfrequently. The formation of white pus shows that\nwhite corpuscles are mobilizing to combat the\ninfection. In World War I, wounded soldiers in\nhospitals suffered agonies having their wounds\ncleaned and dressed frequently; many died as a result\nof such harmful care. In contrast, before antibiotics\nbecame available late in World War II, casts and\ndressings on infected wounds sometimes were not\nchanged for weeks. (The author saw this treatment in\nChina and India and smelled the stench resulting","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":115,"content":"from such \u0022benign neglect\u0022 of American soldiers\u0027\nwounds neglect that helped save limbs and lives.)\n\u2022 Pieces ofglass deeply embedded in flesh: Do not\nprobe with tweezers or a knife inan attempt to extract\nthem. Most glass will come out when the wounds\ndischarge pus.\n\u2022 Burns: Do not apply grease, oil or any other\nmedicine to the burned area. Cover the area securely\nwith a clean. dry dressing or folded cloth. Do not\nchange the dressing frequently. [For most burns, the\nbandage need not be removed until the tenth to\nfourteenth day. Give plenty of slightly salted water:\nabout I teaspoon (~.5 grn) of salt per quart (or liter),\npreferably chilled. in amounts of I to 3 liters\ndaily. \u0022]\n\u2022 Broken bones: Apply simple splints to keep the\nbones from moving. Do not worry about deformities;\nmost can be corrected later by a doctor. Do not\nattempt traction setting of broken bones.\n\u2022 Shock: Keep the victim warm. Place blankets or\nother insulation material under him. Do not cover\nhim with so many blankets that he sweats and suffers\nharmful tluid losses. Give him plenty ofslightly salted\nwater [about a teaspoon of salt in a liter (or quart)\nof water].\n\u2022 Heat prostration: Give adequate fluids. includ-\ning slightly salty water.\n\u2022 Simple childbirth: Keep hands off. Wait until the\nmother has given birth. Do not tie and cut the cord\nunless a potent disinfectant is available. Instead, use\nthe primitive practice of wrapping the cord and the\nplacenta around the infant until they dry. Avoid the\nrisk of infecting the mother by removing the rest of\nthe afterbirth: urge the mother to work to expel it.\n\u2022 Toothache: Do not attempt to pull an aching\ntooth. Decaying teeth will abscess and fall out. This is\na painful but seldom fatal process---one which was\nendured by most of our remote ancestors who\nreached maturity.\nVETERINARIAN ANTIBIOTICS\nPeople who for decades have used antibiotics to\ncombat their infections have not produced normal\nquantities of antibodies. and have subnormal\nresistance to many infections. People who have not\nbeen dependent on antibiotics have these antibodies.\nIn the aftermath of a massive nuclear attack, most\nsun iving Americans would be in rural areas; many\nwould need antibiotics. A large part of their need\ncould be met by the supplies of veterinarian\nantibiotics kept on livestock and chicken farms, at\nfeed mills, and in small towns. Many animals are\ngiven more antibiotics in their short lives than most\nAmericans receive in theirs. Hogs, for example, are\ngiven antibiotics and; or other disease-controlling\nmedicines in their feed each day. In many farming\nareas, veterinary antibiotics and other medicines are\nin larger supply than are those for people. Realistic\npreparations to survive an all-out attack should\ninclude utilizing these supplies.\nRADIATION SICKNESS\nFor the vast majority of Americans who would\nreceive radiation doses from a massive attack, the help\nofcoacts.antibioticg, blood usnaanom.cu; wou}d\nnot be of life-or-death importance. Very few of those\nreceiving acute doses (received within 24 hours) of less\nthan 100 R would become sick, even briefly. All of\nthoseexposed to acute doses between 100Rand 200 R\nshould recover from radiation effects.\u0022 However,\nunderpost-attackconditionsofmultiple stresses\nandprivations, somewhoreceive acuteradiation\ndoses of 100 R to 200 R may die ofinfectious dis-\neases becauseoftheir reduced resistance. Iftotal\ndoses this size or even several times larger are received\novera period of a few months in small doses ofaround\n6 R per day, no incapacitatingsymptoms should result.\nThe human body usually can repair almost all radiation\ndamage if the daily doses are not too large.\nThe majority of those with acute doses oflessthan\nabout 350 R will recover without medical treatment.\nAlmost all of those receiving acute doses of over 600 R\nwould die within a few weeks, even if they were to\nreceive treatment in a typical hospital during\npeacetime. Ifall doctorsand the equipmentand drugs\nneeded for heroic treatments magically were to survive\nan attack - and persons suffering from radiation\nsickness could reach them - relatively few additional\nlives could besaved.\nThe most effective way to reduce losses ofhealth\nand life from radiation sickness is to prevent\nexcessive exposure to radiation. Adequate shelter\nand essential life-support items are the best means of\nsaving lives in a nuclear war. The following informa-\ntion on radiation sickness is given to help the reader\nunderstand the importance of building a good shelter\nand to help him distinguish between symptoms of\ncommon illnesses and first symptoms of radiation\nsickness.\nThe first symptoms of radiation sickness are\nnausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and a general","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":116,"content":"feeling of illness.\u0022 These symptoms begin several\nhours after exposure to acute doses of 100R to 200 R,\nand within 30 minutes or less after receiving a fatal\ndose. A source of probable confusion is the fact that\none or more of these symptoms is experienced by\nmany people when they are first exposed to great\ndanger, as in an air raid shelterduringa conventional\nbombardment.\nThe occupants of a shelter might worry unneces-\nsarily for weeks, mistaking their early emotional\nreactions for the initial phase of radiation sickness.\nThis would be particularly true if they had no\ndependable instrument for measuring radiation, or\nif none of them knew how to use such an\ninstrument.\nThe initial symptoms end within a day or two.\nThen follows the latent phase of radiation sickness,\nduring which the patient experiences few, if any,\nsymptoms. If the dose received was in the non-fatal\nrange. the latent\u0027 phase may last as long as\u0027\n2 weeks.\nIn the final phase. the victim of serious or fatal\nradiation sickness will have reduced resistance to\ninfections and is likely to suffer diarrhea. loss of hair,\nand small hemorrhages of the skin, mouth, and; or\nintestinal tract.

Signifi-\ncantly, no official U.S. estimates have been\nmade available to the public regarding excess\ncancer deaths to be expected if America is\nsubjected to a nuclear attack. However, reliable\nstatistics are available on the numbers of addi-\ntional fatal cancers suffered by persons who\nreceived large whole-body radiation doses at\nHiroshimaandinotherdisasters, andwholived\nfor months to decades before dying. Dr. John N.\nAuxier-who for years was a leading health\nphysicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\nwas one of the American scientists working in\nJapan with Japanese scientists studying the\nHiroshima and Nagasaki survivors, and cur-\nrently is working on radiation problems with\nInternationalTechnology Corporation-in 1986\nsummarized for me the risk of excess fatal\ncancersfrom largewhole-body radiation doses:\n\u0022If1,000peopleeach receivea whole-bodyradia-\ntion dose of 100 rems [or 100 rads, or 100 R],\nabout 10 additional fatal cancers will result.\u0022\nThese 10 fatal cancers will be in addition to\nabout 150 fatal cancers that normally will de-\nvelop among these 1,000 people during their\nlifetimes. This risk is proportional to large\ndoses; thus, if1,000peopleeach receive a doseof\n200 rems, about 20 additional lethal cancer\ncases would be expected.\n\u0022Rem\u0022isan abbreviationfor \u0022roentgenequivalent\n(in) man. \u0027\u00276 The rem takes into account the biological\neffects of different kinds of radiation. For external\ngamma-ray radiation from fallout, the numericalvalue\nof an exposure or dose given in roentgens is approxi-\nmately the same as the numericalvalue given in rems or\nin rads. The rad is the unit of radiation energy\nabsorption in any material and applies to all\nkinds of nuclear radiations. Therefore, for simpli-\ncity\u0027s sake, this book gives both instrument readings\n(exposures) and doses in roentgens (R).\nThe readerdesiringgood information on the long-\nterm and worldwide effects of radiation is referred to\ntwo authoritative reports of the National Academy of\nSciences, Washington, D.C. 20006: The Effects on\nPopulations of Exposures to Low Levels ofIonizing\nRadiation (The BEIR Report made by the NAS\nCommittee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":117,"content":"Radiation) (November 1972); and Long-Term World-\nwlae EJJectsoj \u0022Mu)ilp)e)Vuc)ear-WeaponsDeionai\u0027lOns\n~\\()l5),\nFrom the standpoint of basic survival know-how,\nthese and othercomplicated scientificstudiesshowthat\nto minimizelifetime risksfrom radiation, aftera\nnuclear attack people should:\n\u2022 Provide the best protection against radiation for\npregnant womenand youngchildren, since fetuses and\nthe very young are the most likely to be hurt by\nradiation,\n\u2022 Realize that, with the exception of lung\ncancer, older people are no more susceptible to\nradiation injury than are those in the prime of\nlife, Also, a 65-year-old probably will not live\nlong enough to die of a cancer that takes 20\nyears or more to develop, Many older people, if\nthey know realistic risk estimates, will choose\nto do essential outdoor work and take non-\nincapacitatingradiationdoses in orderto spare\nyounger members of their families the risk of\ngetting cancer decades later.\nPREVENTION OF THYROID DAMAGE\nFROM RADIOACTIVE IODINES\nThere is no medicine that will effectively prevent\nnuclear radiations from damaging the human body\ncells that they strike. However, a salt of the dements\npotassium and iodine. taken orally even in very small\nquantities I : hour to I day before radioactive iodines\nare swallowed or inhaled. prevents about 99% of the\ndamage to the thyroid gland that otherwise would\nresult. The thyroid gland readily absorbs both non-\nradioactive and radioactive iodine. and normally it\nretains much of this element in either or both forms.\nWhen ordinary. non-radioactive iodine is made\navailable in the blood for absorption by the thyroid\ngland before any radioactive iodine ismade available.\nthe gland will absorb and retain so much that it\nbecomes saturated with non-radioactive iodine.\nWhen saturated. the thyroid can absorb only about\nl(i as much additional iodine. including radioactive\nforms that later may become available in the blood:\nthen it is said to be blocked. (Excess iodine in the\nblood is rapidly eliminated by the action of\nthe kidneys.)\nAn excess of ordinary iodine retained in the\nthyroid gland is harmless. but quite small amounts of\nradioactive iodine retained in the thyroid eventually\nwill give such a large rad iation dose to thyroid cells\nthat abnormalities are likely to result. These would\ninclude loss of thyroid function. nodules in the\nthyroid, or thyroid cancer.

They absorbed most of the\nradioactive iodine retained by their thyroid glands as\na result of eating and drinking fallout-contaminated\nfood and water during their two days of exposure.\n(Because of unusual environmental conditions at the\ntime of fallout deposition. some of the retained\nradioactive iodine may have come from the air\nthey breathed.)\nAnextremely small and inexpensive daily dose\nof the preferred non-radioactive potassium salt.\npotassium iodide (KI). iftaken I : hour to Iday before\nexposure to radioactive iodine. will reduce later\nabsorption of .radioactive iodine by the thyroid to\nonly about I% of what the absorption would be\nwithout this preventive measure.

Most people get the iodine they need from foods\nlike iodized salt or fish. The thyroid can \u0022store\u0022 or hold\nonly a certain amount of iodine.\nIn a radiation emergency, radioactive iodine may be\nreleased in the air. This material may be breathed or\nswallowed. It may enter the thyroid gland and damage it.\nThe damage would probably not show itself for years.\nChildren are most likely to have thyroid damage.\nIf you take potassium iodide, it will fill up your thyroid\ngland. This reduces the chance that harmful radioactive\niodine will enter the thyroid gland.\nWHO SHOULD NOT TAKE POTASSIUM IODIDE\nThe only people who should not take potassium iodide\nare people who know they are allergic to iodide. You may\ntake potassium iodide even if you are taking medicines\nfor a thyroid problem (for example, a thyroid hormone or\nantithyroid drug). Pregnant and nursing women and\nbabies and children may also take this drug.\nHOW AND WHEN TO TAKE POTASSIUMIODIDE\nPotassium iodide should be taken as soon as possible\nafter public health officials tell you. You should take one\ndose every 24 hours. More will not help you because the\nthyroid can \u0022hold\u0022 only limited amounts of iodine. Larger\ndoseswill increasethe risk of side effects. You will proba-\nbly be told not to take the drug for more than 10days.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":119,"content":"SIDE EFFECTS\nUsually, side effects of potassium iodide happen when\npeople take higher doses for a long time. Youshould be\ncareful not to take more than the recommended dose or\ntake it for longer than you are told. Side effects are\nunlikely because of the low dose and the short time you\nwill be taking the drug.\nPossible side effects include skin rashes, swelling of the\nsalivary glands, and \u0022iodism\u0022 (metallic taste, burning\nmouth and throat, sore teeth and gums, symptoms of a\nhead cold. and sometimes stomach upset and diarrhea).\nA few people have an allergic reaction with more serious\nsymptoms. These could be fever and joint pain~, or\nswelling of parts of the face and body and at times\nsevere shortness of breath requiring immediate medical\nattention.\nTakingiodide may rarely cause overactivity of the thyroid\ngland, underactivity of the thyroid gland, or enlargement\nof the thyroid gland (goiter).\nWHAT TO DO IF SIDE EFFECTS OCCUR\nIf the side effects are severe or if you have an allergic\nreaction, stop taking potassium iodide.

Several\nof the Soviet and Chinese nuclear test explosions have\nresulted in very light fallout deposition and some\ncontamination of milk by radioactiveiodine in manyof\nthe 50 states. However, serious contamination of milk,\nfruits, and vegetables could result if war fallout from\nmany overseas nuclear explosions were carried\ntoan Americaatpeace. Thesepotentialdangers\nand effective countermeasures are included in\nChapter 18, Trans-Pacific Fallout.\nIf a nuclear war were to be fought in northern\nparts of Asia, or in Europe, or in the Middle East, a\nvery small fraction of the fallout would come to earth\non parts or all ofthe United States.w This fallout would\nnot result in an overwhelming catastrophe to Ameri-\ncans, although the long-term health hazards would be\nserious by peacetime standardsand the economiclosses\nwould be great.w The dangers from radioactive iodine\nin milk produced bycows thatate fallout-contaminated\nfeeds or drank fallout-contaminated water would be\nminimized ifAmericansdid not consumedairy products\nfor several weeks after the arrival of war fallout. Safe\nmilk and other baby foods would be the only essential\nfoods that soon would be in very short supply. The\nparents of babies and young children who had stored\npotassium iodidewould beespeciallythankful they had\nmade this very inexpensive preparation, that can give\n99%-effective protectionto the thyroid. All members of\nfamilies with a supply of potassium iodide could safely\neat a normal diet long before those without it could do\nso.\nThe most dangerous type of radioactive iodine\ndecays rapidly. At the end of each 8-day period it gives\noff only half as much radiation as at the start of that\nperiod. So at the end of 80 days it emits only about\n1/1000as much radiation per hour as at the beginning\nof these 80days. Because of this rapid decay, a 100-day\nsupply of potassium iodide should be sufficient if a\nnuclear war, either overseas or within the United\nStates, were to last no more than a week or two.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":120,"content":"The probabilityof most Americans beingsupplied\nwith prophylactic potassium iodide during a major\nnucleardisasterappearslow.

An authoritative publication-s of the National\nCommitteeon Radiation Protectionand Measurements\nstates: \u0022Supplies of potassium iodide can be stored in a\nvariety of places, including homes, ... \u0022\nIn 1990 the price ofa 2-ounce bottle ofU.S.P.\nsaturatedsolutionofpotassium iodide, which is\nsold by prescription only, ranges from about\n$7.00 to $11.00 in Colorado. A 2-ounce bottle\ncontains about 500 drops. Four drops provide\nthe daily dose of 130 mg for adults and for\nchildren older than one year.

The\npricefor 100 grams (100,000mg) in 1990 is$10.50,\nplus $2.00 to $4.00 for shipping costs. Thus the\ncostin 1990 for a 130-mgdailydose is less than2\ncents. NASCa sells 500 grams (500,000 mg-\nabout one pound) for $35.50, plus $2.00 to $4.00\nfor shipping-making the cost per standard\ndaily dose only one cent.\nFor years of storage, crystalline or granular potas-\nsium iodide is better than a saturated solution. Dry\npotassium iodide should bestored in a dark bottle with\na gasketed, non-metallic cap that screws on tightly.\nTwo-fluid-ounce bottles, filled with dry potassium\niodide as described below, are good sizes for a family.\nSeparate medicine droppers should be kept with stored\nbottles.\nThus at low cost you can buy and store\nenough potassium iodide for your family and\nlarge numbers of your friends and neighbors-\nas I did years ago.\n\u2022 Practical expedient ways to prepare and\ntake daily prophylactic doses of a saturated\nsolution of potassium iodide.\nTo prepare a saturated solution of potassium\niodide, fill a bottle about -60% full of crystalline or\ngranular potassium iodide.

About 2\nounces of crystalline or granular potassium iodide is\nneeded to fill a 2-fluid-ounce bottle about 60% full.)\nNext, pour safe, room-temperature water into the\nbottle until it is about 90% full. Then close the bottle\ntightly and shake it vigorously for at least 2 minutes.\nSome of the solid potassium iodide should remain\npermanently undissolved at the bottom of the bottle;\nthis is proof that the solution is saturated.\nExperiments with a variety of ordinary household\nmedicine droppersdetermined that Idrop ofa saturated\nsolution of potassium iodidecontainsfrom 28to 36 mg\nof potassium iodide. The recommended expedient\ndaily doses of a saturated solution (approximately 130\nmg for adults and children older than one year, and 65\nmg for babies younger than one year) are as follows:\n* For adults and children older than one year, 4\ndrops of a saturated solution of potassium iodide each\n24 hours.\n* For babies younger than one year, 2 drops of a\nsaturated solution of potassium iodide each 24 hours.\nPotassium iodide has a painfully bad taste, so\nbadthata singlecrystalor 1dropofthe saturated\nsolution in a small child\u0027s mouth would make\nhim cry. (A small child would be screaming in\npain before he could eat enough granular or\ncrystalline KI to make him sick. Some KI\ntablets are coated and tasteless.) Since many\npersons willnot takea bad-tastingmedication,especially\nifno short-term health hazardsare likely to resultfrom\nnot taking it, the following two methods of taking a\nsaturated solution are recommended:\n* Put 4drops of the solution into a glass of milk or\nother beverage, stir, and drink quickly. Then drink\nsome ofthe beverage with nothingadded. Ifonly water\nis available, use it in the same manner.\n* If bread isavailable, place 4drops of the solution\non a small piece of it; dampen and mold it into a firm\nball the size of a large pea, about Ys inch in diameter.\nThere is almost no taste if this \u0022pill\u0022 is swallowed\nquickly with water. (Ifthe pill iscoated with margarine,\nthere is no taste.)\nAsstated before, 4drops of the saturated solution\nprovide a dose approximately equal to 130 mg of\npotassium iodide.\n\u2022 Preparing potassium iodide tablets\nto give to infants and small children.\nThe official FDA instructions for using KI\ntablets state that one half of a l30-mg tablet,\n\u0022first crushed\u0022, should be given every 24 hours\nto \u0022babies under one year of age\u0022, and that a\nwhole tablet should be crushed \u0022for small\nchildren.\u0022\nPutting even a small fraction of a crushed\nor pulverized potassium iodide tablet on one\u0027s\ntongueis a startlingexperience,with a burning\nsensation.A slightlyburntsensationcontinues\nfor hours. Therefore, a mother is advised to\nmakethisexperimentwhereherchildrencannot\nsee her.\nTo eliminate the painfully bad taste of a\ncrushed or pulverized KI tablet, first pulverize\nit thoroughly. Next stir it for a minute into at\nleast 2 ounces of milk, orange juice, or cold\ndrink, to make sure that the KI (a salt) is\ncompletely dissolved. Then the taste is not\nobjectionable.Ifonlywateris available, stirthe\npulverized tablet into more than 2 ounces of\nwater.\nKI is a corrosive salt, more injurious than\naspirin to tissue with which it is in direct\ncontact. Some doctors advise taking KI tablets\nafter meals, except when so doing would delay\ntakingtheinitialdose duringanemergency. All\nrecognize that taking a dilute solution of KI is\neasieronthe stomachthan takingthe samedose\nin tablet form. This may be a consequential\nconsideration when taking KI for weeks during\na prolonged nuclear war emergency.\n\u2022 WARNINGS\n* Elemental(free) iodineispoisonous,except\nin the very small amounts in water disinfected\nwith iodine tablets or a few drops of tincture of\niodine. Furthermore, elemental iodine supplied\nby iodine tablets and released by tincture of\niodine dropped into water is not effective as a\nblocking agent to prevent thyroid damage. If\nyou do not have any potassium iodide, DO NOT\nTAKE IODINE TABLETS OR TINCTURE OF\nIODINE.\n* DO NOT MAKE A FUTILE, HARMFUL\nATTEMPT TO EAT ENOUGH IODIZED SALT\nTO RESULTIN THYROID BLOCKING. Iodized\nsalt contains potassium iodide, but in such a\nlow concentration that it is impossible to eat\nenough iodized salt to be helpful as a blocking\nagent.\nOTHER WAYS TO PREVENT\nTHYROID DAMAGE\nBesides the prophylactic use of potassium\niodide, the following are ways to prevent or\nreducethyroiddamage underpeacetime orwar-\ntime conditions:\n* Do not drink or otherwise use fresh milk\nproduced by cows that have consumed feed or","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":122,"content":"116\nwater consequentially contaminated with fall-\noutorotherradioactive material resultingfrom\na peacetimeaccidentorfrom nuclearexplosions\nin a war.\n* As a general rule, do not eat fresh vege-\ntables until advised it is safe to do so. If under\nwartime conditions no official advice is obtain-\nable, avoid eating fresh leafy vegetables that\nwere growing or exposed at the time of fallout\ndeposition; thoroughly wash all vegetables and\nfruits.\n* If a dangerously radioactive air mass is\nbeing blown toward your area and is relatively\nsmall (as from some possible nuclear power\nfacility accidents), andif thereistime, an ordered\nevacuation of your area may make it unneces-\nsary even to take potassium iodide.\n* For protection against inhaled radioactive\niodine, theFDAFinalRecommendations(which\nare mentioned in the preceding section) state\nthat the following measures \u0022should be con-\nsidered\u0022:\u0022 ... sheltering[merelystayingindoors\ncansignificantly reduce inhaleddoses], evacua-\ntion, respiratory protection, and/or the use of\nstable iodide.\u0022\nResearch has beencarried outin an effortto\ndevelop a thyroid protectionprocedure basedon\nthe ordinary iodine solutions which are used as\ndisinfectants. Since iodine solutions such as\ntincture of iodine and povidone-iodine are dan-\ngerous poisons if taken orally, these experi-\nments have utilized absorptionthrough the skin\nafter topical application on bare skin.\nAll reported experimental topical applica-\ntions on human skin have given less thyroid\nprotectionthandoes properoral administration\nofpotassium iodide.

So this family took with them from home\nfour folding chairs and two pieces of plywood (each\n21 inches wide by 6 feet long) tied as part of the load\non top of the family car. Four small wooden boxes\nserved as food containers during the drive to the\nshelter-building site. In the shelter, the boxes were\nused to support the ends of two narrow plywood\nbunks (Fig. 14.1).\nThe family\u0027s system of sleeping and sitting in\nshifts worked reasonably well. There were discom-\nforts: the adults found the two plywood bunks too\nnarrow, and the plywood was so hard that all the\nfamily members used their sleeping bags for padding\nrather than for needed warmth on chilly nights.

Any material that breaks\nup and separates air into spaces no more than 1/8 inch\nORNL-OWG 77-18426\nFig. 15.1. Efficient body insulation.\nacross has efficient cells of \u0022dead\u0022 air. Air that is\nwithin 1/16 inch of any surface-whether that of a\nfilament of goose down or of a piece of paper-is\nslowed down by \u0022sticking\u0022 to that surface and\nbecoming hard to move. Trapped \u0022dead\u0022 air moves\noutward very slowly, carrying heat away from the\nbody at a slow rate-thus minimizing heat losses by\nconvection.\n\u2022 Use windbreaker materials. An outer wind-\nbreaker layer of clothing that is essentially air-tight,\nsuch as a brown paperbag worn overa knit wool cap,\nprevents the escape of warmed air and results in an\ninsulating layer of trapped \u0022dead\u0022 air. A single layer\nof good windbreaker material also prevents cold\noutside air from being blown into the insulating\nmaterial and displacing warmed air (Fig. 15.1).\nThe bestwindbreaker materials permit very little\nair to pass through them, while at the same time they\nallow watervaporto escape. Perspiration that cannot\nbe felt or seen on cool skin continually evaporates,\n.forming warm water vapor close to the skin. This\nmoisture escapes outward through good insulating\nand windbreaker materials; as a result, underlying\nbody insulation remains dry and efficient. Water\nvapor can pass readily through many sheets of\nnewspaper or unglazed brown paper, although not\nenough wind can flow through a single sheet to be\nfelt.\n\u2022 Prevent excessive heat iosses by conduction.\nBody heat also is lost by conduction-the direct flow\nof heat into a colder material. For example, if one\nsleeps in an excellent goose-down sleeping bag laid\ndirectly on cold ground, body weight will compress\nthe down to a small fraction of an inch. This barrier\nto heat flow istoo thin and willcause the body to lose\nheat rapidly to the cold earth.

A bath towel and a paper bag used to\nefficiently insulate head, neck, and shoulders.\nIt is very important to prevent heat losses from\nthe head and neck, which have many blood vessels\nnear the skin surface. Heat losses from these vital\nparts cannot be sensed nearly as well as heat losses\nfrom other parts of the body. Furthermore, blood\nvessels near the surface in the head and neck do not\nautomatically constrict to reduce heat losses, as they\ndo in other parts of the body when heat is being lost\nfaster than it can besupplied by metabolism. So when\na person is in the cold-particularly when inac-\ntive-he should keep his hands, feet, and whole body\nwarmer by insulating his head and neck very well.\n(One difficulty in following this advice is that a well-\ncovered head often will feel unpleasantly warm-\neven sweaty-before one\u0027s body temperature rises\nenough to increase the warming flow of blood to\nhands and feet.)\nINSULATING THE WHOLE BODY\nOccupants of freezing-cold shelters can keep\nwarm enough to sleep without blankets by skillfully\nusing ordinary indoor clothing plus paper and pieces\nof cloth to insulate their whole bodies.

(Pieces of shag rug are\nexcellent.) Plastic film should be placed under the\ninsulating material if the ground is damp.\n\u2022 Go to bed or put on all your body insulation\nbefore you begin to feel cold. Once the loss of body\nheat causes blood vessels in your hands and feet to\nconstrict, it often is hard to get these vesselsto return\nto normal dilation again.\n\u2022 Do not jump up and down or wave yourarms to\nget or to keep warm. The windchill factor is a\nmeasure of air movement over your skin; rapid body\nmovements always cause some such air movement. If\npractical, lie down and cover up; then do muscular\ntension exercises by repeatedly tightening all your\nmuscles so tight that you tremble.\n\u2022 Prevent sweating and the dampening of insula-\ntion by taking off or opening up clothingas you begin\nto exercise, before you begin to sweat.\n\u2022 If you are getting cold, don\u0027t smoke. Nicotine\ncauses blood vessels to constrict and the flow of\nblood to hands and feet to be reduced.\n\u2022 Don\u0027t drink an alcoholic beverage to warm\nyourself.

Fabric duct tape is the best widely\navailable tape.\nFigure 15.7 shows a pair of improvised rain\nchaps. Rain chaps are separate leg coverings, each\nwith a loop to suspend it from one\u0027s belt and usually\nmade large enough to be pulled on and off over the\nshoes and trousers. Rain chaps are better than\nwaterproof trousers for working or walking while\nwearing a poncho or raincoat, because body\nmovements cause drying air to be literally pumped\nunder the chaps. This air keeps trousers and legsdry,\nand therefore warmer.\nFig. 15.7.

Any clothing that keeps fallout\noff the skin helps greatly. The best expedient protection\nis given by an outer layer ofeasily-removable clothing\nsimilarto the improvised rainwearpreviouslydescribed,\nbut fully covering the hair and neck and providing\nplastic trousers instead of chaps.

Although the areas of fires.resulting\nfrom a nuclear explosion generally will be\nabout as extensive as the areas of significant\nblast damage,\u0022 on a clear day a house up to\nabout 8 miles from ground zero can be ignited\nby the thermal pulse of a 1-megaton atrburst,\u0022\nFigure 7.2 in Chapter 7 is a photograph of a car\nset on fire by a nuclear explosion so far away\nthat the car was not even dented by the blast.\nThis photograph indicates how a thermal pulse\ncan go through window glass and ignite cur-\ntains, upholstery, or dry paper, even if flam-\nmable material outdoors is too damp to be\nignited. Furthermore, fires from any cause can\nspread, especially in fallout areas following a\nnuclear attack when firefighters may be unable\nor unwilling to expose themselves outdoors to\nradiation.\nGood protection against carbon monoxide\nis provided by a permanent earth-covered shel-\nter, built with its entry outdoors and well sepa-\nrated from a house and other flammable struc-\ntures, and constructed so that it can be closed\ngas-tight.Boththeair-intake andtheair-exhaust\npipes should be installed so that they can be\nquickly closed air-tight, as with screw-on fit-\ntings.

If\nspecialfiredoorgasketsarenotavailable,rubber\nweatherstripping will serve. To lessen the risk\nof carbon monoxide being pumped into the\nshelter if the house burns and air must be\npumped into the shelter while the fire still is\nsmoldering, the air-intake and pump should be\nat the far end ofthe shelter, and the air-exhaust\n.pipe and emergency exit should be near the\npassageway from the house.\nBe sure to seal electrical conduits leading\nfrom a basementto a connectedshelter,sothatif\nthe house burns carbon monoxide can not flow\nthroughtheconduits intotheshelterwhenfresh\noutdoorairisnotbeingpumpedintothe shelter.\nThe author, while conducting ventilation and\nhabitability tests of an earth-covered blast\nshelterconnected through a tunnel to a house\u0027s\nbasement,observedairflowingoutthrough un-\nsealed conduits, the reverse of such a possible\nlife-endangeringflowof carbonmonoxide.When\nthe shelter was being maintained at a slight\noverpressurebycrankingitsblowerto pumpin\noutdoor air, a little air flowed through the un-\nsealed conduit into the basement.\nFor ways to minimize carbon monoxide\ndangersarisingfromcooking,heating,lighting,\nand smoking, see following sections in this\nchapter.\nRememberthat air contaminated with only\n0.16% carbon monoxide can kill you in 2 to 3\nhours, and 0.04% carbon monoxide causes\nfrontal headaches and nausea in 2 to 3 hours.\nThe Navy sets its safe allowable carbon mon-\noxide concentration in air at 0.01%.

When making plans,\nyoushouldconsultlocalbuildersofsatisfactory\nbasements.

Metal shelters usually\ndevelop small leaks long before they become\ndangerously weakened.\nA l00-occupant, below ground shelter, built\nin 1984 near Dallas, Texas as a prototype blast\nshelterfor industrial workers, wasflooded when\nthe water table rose. The poorly sealed opening\nof this shelter\u0027s emergency exit was below\nground level, and after heavy rains was below\nthe water table. A prudently designed shelter\nhas the top of its emergency exit slightly above\nthe surface of the surrounding earth, as illus-\ntrated in Fig. 17.2. All underground electric\nconduits leading down into a shelter must be\nwell sealed to prevent entry of water.\nTo prevent a wholly or partially below-\nwater-table shelter from becoming wet inside\nsooner or later, it should have a sump and an\nautomatic sump pump todischarge waterto the\nground outside. If at any time you find that the\nsump pump is discharging an appreciable\namount of water, you may have a serious wet-\nshelter problem if electric power fails after an\nattack.\nA manually operated bilge pump and a\nsufficiently long discharge hose can be bought\nfor about $20.00 from marine supply mail order\nfirms, including West Marine Products, Box\n5189, SantaCruz, California95063, and Defender\nIndustries, Inc., P.O.

This will eliminate the costs of\nbackfilling with gravel or crushed rock.\nNON-FLOATABLE SHELTERS\nIn most localities the water table usually is\nbelowthedepthofexcavationneededto buildor\ninstall a belowground shelter. In some areas,\nhowever, after rainy periods the water table\nmay rise until it is only a foot or two below the\nsurface. Then a watertight shelter may float\nupward through the surroundingsaturatedsoil,\nunless its weight plus the weightofits covering\nearth is sufficienttowithstandits buoyancy. (In\nmany places swimming pools are kept full to\nprevent them from being cracked by uneven\nbuoyant forces if the water table rises.)\nDramaticexamplesoffloating shelterswere\nsteel blast shelters, guaranteed by contractors\nto be watertight, that were installed under the\nlawns of some Houston, Texas homes shortly\nafter the Cuban Missile Crisis. When the water\ntable rose afterheavy rains, these shelterscame\nup to the surface like giant mushrooms, to the\nfrustrated dismay of their owners and the satis-\nfaction of anti-defense newspaper feature\nwriters.\nThe most expensive permanent family fall-\nout shelter described in a Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency free handout (pamphlet\nH-12-1) is floatable. It is designed to be built of\nreinforced concretecoveredby a flagstone patio\nonly about3 inches abovethe ground. Its6-inch-\nthick concrete roof is covered by a total thick-\nness ofonly6 inches ofsand andflagstone. Like\nthe rest of FEMA\u0027s permanent shelters, no\nprototype of this approximately PF-40 shelter\nwas built, nor is there any record of anyone\nactually having built this shelter. In contrast,\nthe belowground shelterillustratedbyFigs. 17.1\nand 17.2 would not float even if it did not have\nassured gravity drainage of the surrounding\nsoil through the perforated drain pipes in the\ngravel on which it rests, because this shelter is\nweighted down by the thick earth berm on its\nroof.\nADEQUATE,DEPENDABLE\nVENTILATION/COOLING\nBasic facts that you need to provide ade-\nquate, dependable ventilation for a small or","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":146,"content":"medium sized shelter are given in Chapter 6,\nVentilation and Cooling of Shelters. A good\npermanentshelterhastwo ventilation systems:\n\u2022 The primary ventilation system of a small\npermanent shelter should utilize a manually\noperated centrifugal blower, or a homemade\nPlywood Double-Action Piston Pump. (See Ap-\npendix E.) A satisfactory air pump must be\ncapable of supplying adequate outdoor air\nthrough an air-intake pipe, a filter, and an air-\nexhaustpipe. (See Figs. 17.1and 17.2.)\u0022Adequate\noutdoorair\u0022for a smallsheltermeans atleast 15\ncubicfeet perminuteperoccupantfor the cooler\npartsofthe United States,andatleast30 cfm per\noccupant in, most of the country. Most per-\nmanent shelters have centrifugal blowers that\ncan notdeliver an adequate volume ofairinhot\nweather for each planned occupant.\nFor a medium sized permanent shelter,\ninstalling two or more manually powered air\npumps is both mor~ dependable and more eco-\nnomicalthan providinganemergencygenerator\nand its engine to supply power to an electric\nblower. The Swiss, who have made the world\u0027s\nbestand mostexpensive percapitapreparations\nto survive a war, use one or more hand-cranked\ncentrifugal blowers to ventilate most of their\nshelters.\n\u2022 The multi-week and/or emergency ventila-\ntion system of a permanent shelter that has an\nemergency exit should depend on a homemade\nKAP, made before a crisis and kept readyto use.\n(See Appendix B, How to Make and Use a\nHomemadeShelter-VentilatingPump,theKAP.)\nByopeningboththeentrance andtheemergency\nexit, the shelter is provided withtwo large,low-\nresistance openings through which a KAP can\npump large volumes of air with minimum\nwork.\nWarning: Keep screen doors and/or screen\npanels ready to protect all openings againstthe\nswarmsof flies and mosquitoeslikelytobecome\ndangerous pests in fallout areas. UseyourKAP\nto pump adequate air through screens. Insect\nscreens greatly reduce natural ventilation, as\nthe author first noted in Calcutta while a bed-\nridden patient in a stifling hot ward of a hastily\nconstructed Armyhospital. Becausethere were\nno fans or blowers to pump in outdoor air or\ncirculate the air inside, window screens were\nopenedinthedaytimewhenmalariamosquitoes\nwerenotflying. Thedoctors correctlyconcluded\nthatthe temperaturereduction when the screens\nwere opened helped the patients more than they\nwere endangered by the entering filthy flies.\nAdequate ventilation is more important than\nprotection from flies, butwith a KAP and insect\nscreens you can have both. Flies, mosquitoes,\nand other insects can be killed very effectively\nby occasionally spraying or painting screens\nand other alighting surfaces with water solu-\ntions of insecticides containing permithin and\nsold in many farm stores.\nADVICE ON VENTILATION\nOPENINGS AND FITTINGS\n\u2022 Install ventilation pipes large enough to\nreduce resistancetoairflow, thusincreasingthe\nvolumeofairthattheshelter\u0027spumpcandeliver.\nA shelter with a 200-cfm pump (such as the\nhomemakeable Plywood Double-Action Piston\nPump described in Appendix E) should have\n5-inch galvanized steel pipe. The pumps that\nare installed in most family shelters deliver\nonly about 100 cfm or less. Four-inch pipe is\nadequate for use with pumps this small, pro-\nvided that the pipes have no more than two\nright-angle turns below each gooseneck. (A 90-\ndegree L gives about as much resistance to\nairflow as 12 feet of straight pipe.)\n\u2022 Make and installa gooseneckwith itsmouth\nabouttwicethediameterofthe pipe, as indicated\nin Fig. 17.1. The purpose of such a gooseneck is\nto preventmoreofthe largerdescendingfallout\nparticles from being pumped or blown into the\nshelter. For example, if 200 cfm of air is being\npumped into a shelt~r through a gooseneck of\n5-inch-diameter pipe with its mouth also 5\ninchesindiameter,the velocityofthe air up into\nthe mouth of the gooseneck is about 1,440 feet\nper minute, and sand-like spherical particles\nsmaller than approximately 500 microns in\ndiameteralso are \u0022sucked\u0022 Up.6Butifthe5-inch\ngooseneck\u0027s mouth is 10 inches across, then the\nupward air velocity is reduced to about 360 feet\nper minute, and only particles smaller than\napproximately 180microns across are \u0022sucked\u0022\nup. Particles in the 180 to 500 micron-diameter\nrange are relatively large and fall to earth in\nabout 40 to 70 minutes from 35,000 feet, the base\nof the mushroomcloudofa 1-megatonexplosion.\n(SeeFig.6.4.)Theseparticlesareverydangerous\nbecause theirradioactivityhashadlittletimeto\ndecay, and should be kept out of a shelter\u0027s\nventilationsystem. Furthermore, largeparticles\nretained in a shelter\u0027s filter restrict airflow\nsooner than do small ones. (If an appropriately\ncurved piece of5-inch steelpipecannotbefound\nin a salvage yard or elsewhere, a good welder\ncan use 5-inch steel pipe to make a substitute\ngooseneck with two 90-degree turns.)\n\u2022 Do not use air intake hoods on a permanent\nshelter\u0027s pipes, because hoods are not as effec-\ntive as goosenecks in \u0027preventing fallout par-\nticles from entering ventilation pipes. Also,","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":147,"content":"pumping a given volume of air through a hood\nis more work than pumping the same volume\nthrough a gooseneckwithequalcross-sectional\nareas.\n\u2022 Never install any screen inside a gooseneck\nor air intake hood, because spider webs and the\ndebris that sticks to webs will greatly reduce\nairflow. The author saw a gooseneck with a\nblast valve built inside it; spider webs and\nattached trash on this blast valve had conse-\nquentially reduced the volume of air that this\nshelter\u0027s pump coulddeliver. Of course a screen\nis much more easily obstructed than a blast\nvalve.YetFEMA\u0027swidelydistributed pamphlets\non a permanent Horne Fallout Shelter (H-12-1)\nand on a Home Blast Shelter (H-12-3) continue\nin successive editions to give detailed instruc-\ntions for making an air intake hood with a\nscreen soldered inside it. Butthese sheltersthat\nnever have been built have much more serious\nweaknesses, including the likelihood that the\naboveground parts of the ventilation pipes of\nthe blast shelter would be bent over or broken\noff by blast-wind-hurled parts of buildings and\ntrees, even in suburbia. (350 mph is the maxi-\nmum velocity of the blast wind where the blast\noverpressure is 15 psi from a 1-megaton air\nburst.s The ventilation openings of the blast-\ntested expedient blast shelters described in\nAppendix D are much more likely to remain\nserviceableafter beingsubjectedto severeblast\neffects, because blast-protector logs are placed\naround their openings, that are only a few\ninches above ground level.)\nPREVENTION AND CONTROL\nOF CONDENSATION\nA shelter can be watertight, yet at certain\nseasons of the year its walls, ceiling, and floor\ncan be dripping wet withwater condensed from\nenteringoutdoor air. (This is a seriousproblem,\nexcept in arid parts of the West.) During the\nwinter months a shelter and its surrounding\nearth get cold; then especially on some spring\ndays the dew point of entering outdoor air is\nhigher than the temperature of the shelter\u0027s\ninterior surfaces. As a result, condensation\noccurs onthose surfaces that are coolerthan the\ndew point of the pumped-through air.\nThe most dramatic example that I have\nobserved of the seriousness ofthis condensation\nproblem was the drippingceilingand wetwalls\nof a reinforced-concrete, family-sized shelter\nthat I inspected on an early spring day at the\nCivil Defence College in Yorkshire, England.\nSuchcondensation also can occur in above-\nground structures. Before World War II I had a\n600-year-oldbedroominQueen\u0027s College, Oxford\nUniversity. My bedroom\u0027s outer wall was made\nof solid limestone blocks about 15 inches thick,\nsimply plastered and painted on the inside. On\nsome spring days moisture condensed on the\ninside of the cold outer wall, ran down, and\ncollected in little puddles on the floor. The\noccasional small coal fire in my adjacent study\nwas barely sufficienttograduallyevaporatethe\nwater and reduce my bedroom\u0027s humidity\nenough to prevent mold from forming. This\noften-repeated occurrence proves the inade-\nquacyofmerelykeepinganelectriclightturned\non for heat to prevent condensation inside an\nuninsulated shelter built in a cool, frequently\nhumid locality.\nCondensation and resultant 100 percent\nhumid air can rust and eat away most steel\npipes. Ventilation pipes should be made of\ngalvanized steel or other materials that are\nundamaged by seasonal condensation and 100\npercent humidity. In Connecticut I saw shelter\nventilation pipes made of steel protected with\ntwo coats of marine paint; they were badly\nrusted only two years after installation.\nOperating it dehumidifier with automatic\ncontrols is the most practical way for most\npeopleto preventcondensation andotherdamp-\nness problems in a shelter during peacetime.\nAlmost all of the Chinese shelters that I in-\nspected in six cities are dual-use shelters and\ntypicallyareequippedwithlargedehumidifiers.\nA small dehumidifier adequate for a family\nshelter can be bought from a dependable mail\norder company, such as Sears, for about $250 in\n1987.\nTo save floor space and facilitate removal\nof water, a dehumidifier should be installed\nnear a shelter\u0027s ceiling. Then water from the\ndehumidifier can be disposed of most easily\nthrough a pipe or tube providing gravity drain-\nage, best to the outdoors, second best to the\nsewer. (After a nuclear attack the sewer system\nmay become clogged and sewage may back up\nandflow into a belowground room havingpipes\nthat normallydischarge intothe sewer, andthat\nlackcheckvalves.) Ifthe abovementionedways\nof removing water are not possible, a sump and\nan automatic sump pump discharging water to\nthe ground outdoors can solve the peacetime\nwater disposal problem.\nAfter an attack, electric power can be ex-\npected to fail and shelter humidity will have to\nbe controlled as much as possiblebyventilation\nwith outdoor air. A simplewayto learnwhento\nventilate a shelter to dry it was described in a\nRussian article on shelter management: Keep","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":148,"content":"several small cans of water in the shelter. They\nwill be at about the same temperature as the\nshelter walls when the shelter is closed and is\nnot being ventilated. If a filled can is exposed to\noutdoor air for about 10 minutes and moisture\ncondenses on it (as a glass filled with an iced\ndrink \u0022sweats\u0022on a humid summerday), do not\nventilate the shelter. If no moisture condenses\non the can, ventilate.\nA WALK-IN ENTRANCE\nOnly a small fraction of permanent family\nshelters without a walk-in entrance have \u0022been\nkept in good condition for many years. Per-\nmanent Iamrly shelters with vertical or crawl-\nin entrances are found so inconvenient that the\nbigmajority ofowners do notuse them even for\nrotatedfood storage. In normal peacetime, most\nwell informed Americans concerned with pro-\ntectingtheirfamiliesconcludethatonlya shelter\nskillfullydesigned for dual use justifiesthecost\nof building and maintaining it. Significantly,\nChinese civil defense has come to the same\nconclusionregardingChinesepermanentpublic\nshelters: thosethathave been built, and thatstill\nare being built, are almost all useful both in\npeacetime and in wartime.\nIf a family can use its shelter without\nhaving to go outside and be exposed to rain,\nsnow, cold, or night problems, its dual use\nshelter will be a more valuable peacetime asset\nthan a shelter not directly connected to the\nhouse. Furthermore, a directlyconnectedshelter\ncan be entered more quickly in a crisis, and\nprobably will reduce post-attack exposures to\nfallout radiation received by persons carrying\nthings into the shelter, or by those moving\nabout post-attackto protectthe home. The main\ndisadvantages of a directly connected shelter\nare that it usually provides poorer protection\nagainstheat, smoke andcarbonmonoxideifthe\nhouse burns and that it is more expensive to\nbuild than an earth-covered shelter with an\noutdoor walk-in entrance, such as the one illus-\ntrated in Figs. 17.1 and 17.2.\nAN EMERGENCY EXIT THAT ALSO\nPROVIDES A SECOND LARGE\nVENTILATION OPENING\nHaving an emergency exit in a fallout shel-\nter is not as important as having one in a blast\nshelter, unless the fallout shelter is under or\nconnected to a building. (Since buildings are\nlikely to burn, itis importantto have a means of\nescape.) However, an emergency exit makes\nany shelter more practical to live in than a\nshelterwithonlyonelargeopening- especially\nin a heavyfallout areawhereitmaybe necessary\nto stay inside most of the time for weeks or\nmonths. Occupants of a shelter with only one\nlarge opening will not have adequate natural\nventilation and will have to keep laboriously\npumpingair- atleastintermittently- through\nthe air-supply pipes to maintain liveable tem-\nperature and/or humidity conditions.\nByopeningboth a shelter\u0027sentrance and its\ne-mergency exit,andtakingmeasurestoprevent\nthe entry of rain, snow, and all but the smallest\nfallout particles (see Appendix F), natural ven-\ntilationwillbeadequatemostofthe time, except\ninhot,cal-mweather.\\Nithtwolar\u0027E,eo\\)en\\:n.\u0027E,s,a\nhomemade KAP (see Appendix B) can be used\nto pump enough outdoorairthrough the shelter,\nwith much less work than is required to pump\nless air with a relatively high-pressure pump\nthrough typical ventilation pipes.\nA DEPENDABLE, HIGH-PROTECTION-\nFACTOR EMERGENCY EXIT\nOccupants of a shelter with a dependable\nemergency exit will have less fear of being\ntrappedifthe mainentryisblocked.Iftheyopen\nthe exit, they also will be able to ventilate the\nshelter with natural ventilation through the\nentry and the exit, or with forced ventilation by\noperating a KAP.\nTo provide excellent radiation protection, a\ntypical high-PF emergency exit is filled with\nsand. Suchanexithas a bolted-onsteel plate on\nits bottom inside the shelter, and an easily cut,\nwaterproof, plastic-film covering over its top,\nwhich is a few inches below ground level..\nObvious disadvantages of this typical sand-\nfilled emergency exit include the difficulty of\nsafely removing the bottom plate while sand is\npressing down on it, and the impossibility of\ncutting the plastic film over the top of the exit\nwithout having fallout-contaminated earth fall\non the person who does the cutting, and into the\nshelterroom. Furthermore,iftheearth covering\nthetopofanemergencyexitisfrozen, occupants\nmay be unable to break through it and get out.\nAn improved design of sand-filled emer-\ngency exit was conceived by Dr. Conrad V.\nChester of Oak Ridge National Laboratory and\nin 1986 was further improved, built, and tested\nin a full-scale model bythe author. As shown in\nFig. 17.2, the sand in this 26 x 26-inch square\nvertical exit was supported by a piece of 3/4-\ninch exterior plywood, that should be of the\npreviously mentioned rot-proof type, pressure\nimpregnated with wood preservative.\nInthecenterofthis251f2x 251f2-inch plywood\nsand-support was an 8-inch-diameter hole cov-\nered withtwo thicknessesofstrongnyloncloth.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":149,"content":"The double thickness of cloth was firmly at-\ntached to the plywood by being folded over four\n3/16-inch galvanized steel rods, that were\nstapledtothe plywoodwith galvanizedpoultry-\nnetting staples.

After a shelter occupant has\ncutoutthe nylon cloth coveringthe hole and all\nbut about 30 lbs of sand has fallen or been\npushed by his hand down into the shelter room,\nhe can tilt the plywood sand-support up into a\nvertical position, and then turn it 45 degrees.\nThe26-inch widthofthe sand-supportpermitsit\nto be easily lifted down through the 32.5-inch-\nlong diagonal ofthe 23 x 23-inch square hole in\nthe shelter\u0027s roof slab.\nNote the North-pointing arrow on the ply-\nwood sand-support shown in Fig. 17.3. Because\nthe exit of this shelter was not made perfectly\nsquare, the sand-support could be tilted most\neasily from its horizontal position into the\nvertical position if it was oriented so that its\nside marked \u0022N\u0022 wasto the north. A similar\u0022N\u0022\narrow on the lower side of this sand-support\nenabled a man below it, after the exit\u0027s lid was\ntied down and before the exit was filled with\nsand, to position the sand-support for easy\ntilting and removal when the last of the sand\nwas being cleared from this exit. The sand-\nsupportshouldbe cutto fit the exitaftertheexit\nis completed, because it is difficult to build an\nexit exactly to specified dimensions.\nThe top of the emergency exit should be a\nfew inches above the earth around it, to prevent\nrainwateronthe groundfrom possiblyrunning\nin. Securely cover the exit\u0027s top with a lid of\nlI8-inch galvanized steel having a threaded\nplug-hole (cutfrom a steelbarrel) weldedover a\nhole cut in the lid\u0027s center. Such a lid can be\nclosely fitted to the top of a concrete exit by\noiling it and pressing it against the concrete\nbefore the concrete begins to set.\nBefore filling the exit with sand, while\ninside the exittiethe liddownoneachofitsfour\nsides with nine loops of 3/32-inch nylon cord\nrepeatedly tightened between four galvanized\nsteel\u0022V\u0027s\u0022 welded to the lower side of the lid,\nand four\u0022 V\u0027s\u0022 set in the shelter\u0027s walls and\nroof slab, as indicated in Fig. 17.2. Use pliers to\ntighten, stretch, and hold the nylon cord while\nmakingtheloops. Then afterthe plywood sand-\nsupport is positioned in the bottom of the exit,\nthe exit can be filled by pouring dry sand\nthrough the plug-hold in the steel lid. Finally,\nthe plug-holeshould be closed so that it cannot\nbe opened, and then made waterproof. To make\ndoubly sure that the lid will not rust, paint it\nwith a cement paint, and then with whatever\ncolor outdoor paint you want.\nA shelter occupant can cut out the nylon\ncloth covering the hole in the sand-support,\nremove all sand and the plywood sand-support\nfrom this exit, cutthe four tightenednylon-cord\nmultipleloopsholdingdown thelid,pushoffthe\nlid, and then climb up and step outside - all in\nless than 5minutes, evenifdamp sandhas been\nused to fill the exit.

Additional space is needed if you\nplan to use your shelter as a workshop, or as a\nfallout shelter to save a few ofyour unprepared\nfriends without endangering your own family.\nSEATS/BUNKS/SHELVES\nSeats and overhead bunks built like those\nspecified in Fig. 17.4 and pictured in Fig. 17.5\nenable more shelter occupants to sit and sleep\nmore comfortably in -Iess space than when\nusing any other shelter furnishings known to\nthe author. Note that the seat has an adjustable\nbackrest. This backrest is similar to the fine-\nmesh nylon fishnet backrests tested in a proto-\ntype of an expensive blast shelterdesigned and\nfurnished at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nShelter habitability tests have proved the\nneed for backrests. Even some young German\nsoldiers had painfully sore backs after sitting\non ordinary benches during a 2-week shelter\noccupancy test.\nBackrests should be installed in peacetime\nand kept ready for crisis use, rolled up against\ntheir upper attachments and covered. Then\neasily removeable storage shelves, if needed,\ncan be installed between benches and overhead\nbunks.\nTo sitorsleepcomfortably,pullthebedsheet\nforward and then sit on about the outer foot of\nthe 2-foot-wide seat.\nAlthough this 5-occupant shelter is illus-\ntrated with a bunk for each family member, it is\n39\u0022 BETWEEN PAIRS OF 4\u0022.4\u0022 SUPPORTS\n39\u0022\n----\u0022\u0027\u0027---------\nNOTCHED\nFig. 17.4.

Oftenthe space between\nan overhead bunk and the ceiling can best be\nused by making easily removeable additional\nshelves.\nWATER\n\u2022 Water needs: Even most well-maintained\nsheltersdo not haveenough waterfor prolonged\noccupancy. A permanentsheltershould provide\neach occupant with at least 30 gallons of safe\nwater - enough for an austere month, exceptin\nvery hot weather.\n\u2022 Contafners: The most practical water con-\ntainer for shelter storage is a 5-gallon rigid\nplastic watercan with a handle, a largediameter\nopening for quick filling and emptying, and a\nsmall spout for pouring small quantities. A 5-\ngallon watercan ofthis type sells for about$5 in\ndiscount stores.\nThe plastic bottles that household chlorine\nbleach is sold in also are good for multi-year\nstorage of drinking water, as are glass jugs.\nPlastic milk jugs are not satisfactory, because\nafter a few years they often become brittle and\ncrack.\nSome shelter owners do not realize that,\nalthough a sheltercan bekeptdry in peacetime,\nexcept in the arid Westits airis likelyto become\nextremely humid after a few days of crowded\noccupancy. Very humid air soon softens and\nweakens cardboard containers of food and\nflexible water bags.\n\u2022 Disinfectingfor multi-yearstorage: To store\nsafe water and keep it safe for years, first\ndisinfect the container by rinsing it with a\nstrong solution ofchlorine bleach. Then rinse it\nwith safe water before filling it with the clear,\nsafe waterto be stored. Next, disinfectby adding\nhousehold bleach that contains 5.25% sodium\nhypochlorite as its only active ingredient, in the\nquantities specified in this book\u0027s Waterchapter\nfor disinfecting muddy or cloudy water. To 5\ngallons, add 1scantteaspoon of bleach. Finally,\nto prevent possible entry of air contaming\ninfective organisms through faulty closures,\nseal the container\u0027s closures with duct tape.\n\u2022 Making efficient use of storage space: A 5-\ngallon rigid plastic water container typically\nmeasures 7 x 12 x 21 inches, including the\nheightof itsspout.Nine such5-galloncontainers\ncan be placed on a 2 x 3-footfloor area. Twenty-\nseven 5-gallon containers, holding 135 gallons\nofwater, can be stored on and over6 square feet\noffloor ifyou make a waterstorage stand24 x 42\nx 48 inches high, built quite like the seat with\noverhead bunk described in the Seats/Bunks/\nShelves section of this chapter. This easily\nmoveable storage stand should have two ply-\nwood shelves, one 24 inches and the other 48\ninches from the floor.\n\u2022 Using filled containers for shielding: Filled\n5-gallon watercontainerscanbemovedquickly\nto provide additional shielding where needed to\nincrease the protection factor of all or part of a\nshelter. For example, near the inner door of the\nshelter illustrated by Figs. 17.1 and 17.2 the\nprotection factor is lessthan 1000. Butifenough\nfilled water containers are placed so as to cover\nthe door with almost the equivalent of an 18-\ninch-thick \u0022wall\u0022 of shielding water, the PF of\nthe partofthe shelter room nearthe doorcan be\nraised to about PF 1000.\nIf a shelter has twenty-seven 5-gallon cans\nofwaterstoredonand undertheabove-described\n2-shelf water storage stand, then in less than 3\nminutes 2 men can shield the shelter door quite\nadequately. All they have to do is take the 18\ncans off the shelves, put 9 of them on the floor\nagainstthe door and doorway, movethe storage\nstand over the 9 door-shielding cans, and place\nthe remaining 18 cans on the stand\u0027s 2 shelves.\nEqually good doorway shielding can be\nprovidedbyplacingatleasta 24-inch thickness\nof containers full of dense food, such as whole-\ngrainwheator sugar, againstthedoorway. Two\n55-gallon drums of wheat, each weighing about\n400 pounds, can be quickly \u0022walked\u0022 on a con-\ncrete floor and positioned so as to shield the\nlower part of a doorway. Heavy containers on\nthe floor can provide a stable base on which to\nstack other shielding material.\n\u2022 A water well: The best solution to the water\nproblem quite often is a well inside the shelter.\nIn many areasthe watertable islessthan50 feet\nbelowthe surface, and a 50-foot well, casedwith\n6-inch steel pipe, can be drilled and completed\nfor about $2000. Well drilling should be done\nafter the shelter excavation has been dug and\nbeforetheconcreteshelterfloorhas beenpoured.\nAn in-shelter well would be of vital importance\nnotonly to the occupants ofa family shelter, but\nlater on probably to nearby survivors.

Then in an emergency the pipe and the\nattached pump can be pulled by hand out ofthe\nwell, with only a saw being needed to cut off\nlengths of the plastic pipe as it is pulled. After\nthe well casing has been cleared of pump, pipe\nand wires, ahomemade 2-foot-Iong bail-bucket\non a nylon rope can be used-to draw plenty of\nwater. (See Chapter 8, Water, for instructions.)\n\u2022 Local water sources: Most Americans\u0027 nor-\nmal piped water would not run for months after\na large nuclear attack. A month\u0027s supply of\nwaterstoredinyoursheltershouldbeadequate, .\nbecause, even ifyour area has heavy fallout, in\nless than a month radioactive decay will make\nit safe to haul water from nearby sources.\nAn important part ofyour shelter prepara-\ntions is to locate nearby wells, ponds, streams,\nand streambeds that when dry frequently have\nwater a foot or two below the surface. The\nauthor has found that digging a water pit in an\napparentlydry streambedoftensuppliesenough\nfiltered water to satisfy several families\u0027 basic\nneeds. To keep the sides of a water pit dug in\nunstable ground from caving in, you should\ndrive a circle of side-by-side stakes around the\noutside of your planned pit before starting to\ndig. With more work and materials, you and\nothersurvivorsneedingfiltered watercoulddig\na well like the Chinese water source shown on\npage 71. If you are in a fallout area, before\ndrinking water from a water. pit you should\nfilter it through clayey soil to remove fallout\nparticles and dissolved radioactive isotopes, as\ndescribed in the Water chapter. Of course it is\nprudent to chlorinate or boil all surface and\nnear-surface water after it has been filtered.\nFOOD\n\u2022 Advantages of a one-year supply: A family\nthat expends the money and work to build and\nprovision its own shelter should store a year\u0027s\nsupply oflong-lastingfoods. Ifpost-attackcon-\nditionsenableyouto continuelivingandmaking\na living near your home, having a year\u0027s food\nsupply will be a tremendous advantage. And if\nyour area is afflicted with such dangerous,\ncontinuing fallout radiation and!or other post-\nattack conditions that surviving unprepared\nresidents are soon forced to evacuate to better\nareas, thenyourandyourfamily\u0027s chanceswill\nbe better if hunger does not force you to move\nduring the chaotic first few months after a\nnuclear attack.\n\u2022 Costs of a one yearfood supplyfor a family\nshelter: Table 17.1 shows the wide range of 1987\ncosts of the basic survival foods for multi-year\nstoragethatarelisted andexplainedonpage88.\nThe delivered costs listed in the right hand\ncolumn include UPS shipping charges in the\nnearest and least expensive of UPS\u0027s 8 zones.\nFor UPS shipping costs to the most distant\npoints in the 48 states, add 34 cents per pound\ndelivered.\nAll the foods in this survival ration, if\nstored in moisture-proof and insect-proof con-\ntainers (the non-fat milk powder should be in\nnitrogen-packed cans), will provide healthful\nnutrition for at least 10 years. The exception is\nthe multi-vitamin tablets, which should be re-\nplaced every 2 or3 years, depending on storage\ntemperature. Soa family thatspendsabout$300\nper member on such a one year survival ration\ncan consider that each of its members has been\ncovered by famine insurance for $30 a year.\nScurvywill be thefirst incapacitating,then\nlethal vitamin deficiency to afflict unprepared,\nuninformed Americans. A multi-vitamin tablet\ncontains enough vitamin C to fully satisfy the\ndaily requirement. However, a prudent shelter\nowner also should store vitamin C tablets, that\nkeep for years. One hundred 500-mg generic\nvitamin C tablets - 50,000 mgof vitamin C - in\n1987 typically cost about $1.20 in a discount\nstore; a 10mgdailydose prevents scurvy. After\na nuclear war in some areas vitamin C will be\nworth many times its weight in gold.\n\u2022 SourcesafthebasicfoodslistedinTable17.1:\n*Wheat: If you live in a wheat producing\narea, the least expensive sources of ready-to-\nstore wheat usually are local seed-cleaning\nfirms.

Only after receiving it by mail\norderdidhelearn byreadingthe accompanying\ndirections that it is not made for grinding corn.\nCOOKING AND HEATING\n\u2022 Safety precautions: The first rule for safe\ncookingand/or heatingin a shelteris todo it as\nnear as practical to the exhaust opening. If the\nfire isunderanexhaustpipe, install a hood over\nthe fire. Operate the shelter ventilating pump\nwhen cooking, unless a natural airflow out\nthroughtheexhaustopeningcan be observedor\nfelt. Keepflammablematertals,especiallycloth-\ning, well away from any open fire.\n\u2022 Hazardous fuels: Charcoal is the most haz-\nardous fuel to burn in confined spaces, because\nitgivesoffmuchcarbonmonoxide.In a crowded\nshelter there are obvious dangers in using the\nefficient little stoves carried by backpackers\nandinstoringtheireasilyvaporized andignited\nfuels.\n\u2022 \u0022Canned heat\u0022: These convenient fuels are\nexpensive. Sterno, widely used to heat small\nquantities offood and drink, typically retails in\n7-ounce cans for what amounts to about $9.00\nper pound.\n\u2022 Wood: The safest fuel to burn in a shelter is\nwood, the most widely available and cheapest\nfuel. Furthermore, wood smoke is irritating\nenough to usually alert shelter occupants to\nsome.times accompanying carbon monoxide\ndangers. Scrap lumber cut into short lengths,\nmade into bundles and stored in plastic bags,\noccupies minimum spaceand staysdry. Keep a\nsaw and a hatchet in your shelter.\n\u2022 Bucket Stove: The most efficient, practical\nand safe stove with which to cook or heat for\nweeks or months in a family shelteris a Bucket\nStove, that burns either small pieces of wood or\nsmall \u0022sticks\u0022 of twisted newspaper. (See the\nFood chapter.) Especially if you believe that\nyou mayhaveto live inyourshelterfor months\nor that your normal fuel will not be available\nafter a\u0027nuclear attack, you should make and\nstore at least two Bucket Stoves.\n\u2022 An improved Fireless Cooker: To save a\ngreat deal of fuel and time, particularly with\nslow-cooking grains and beans, make a very\nwell insulated Fireless Cooker similar to the\nexpedient one described on page 82 of the Food\nchapter. Make a plywood box, first measuring\ncarefully to insure that, when completely lined\nwith 4 inches of styrofoam, the styrofoam will\nfit closelyaround a large, liddedpotwrappedin\na bath towel. An excellent Fireless Cooker is a\nwar survival asset that also is useful for peace-\ntime cooking.\n(To boil about twice as much wheat flour-\nmeal in a given pot as can be boiled when\nmaking wheat mush, and to use the minimum\namount of water and fuel, salt a batch of the\nflour-meal, add enough water while working it\nto make a stiff dough, then make dough balls\nabout 11/2 inches in diameter, and roll them in\nflour-meal.

If\nburned in one of the candle-lamps described\nbelow, this candle gives enough lightto read by\nfor 15 hours.\nThe author has been able to find only one\nmail order source of 15-hour candles like those\nsold by the millions in New Mexico: Prepared-\nness Products, 3855 South 500 West, Salt Lake\nCity, Utah 84115. A case of 144 candles sells for\n$49.00, FOB in 1990. When UPS shippingcharges\nare added, the delivered costis between\u002735and40\ncents for each 15-hour candle, depending on the\ndistance shipped.\nPersons who stock a permanent shelter\nshould realize that after a nuclear war fats, oils,\nparaffin, and all other sources of light will be in\nextremely short supply for at least many\nmonths. Light at a delivered cost of about two\ncents per hour will be a bargain blessing.\n* The second-best shelter candle tested by\nthe author is a standard Plumber\u0027s Candle, that\nretails for about 60 cents in many stores nation-\nwide, and that burns for about 10 hours with a\nbrighter flame than a votive-type candle.\nTwo types of expedient candle-lamps were\nproved by multi-day tests to be the most prac-\ntical:\n* The best expedient candle-lamp is made of\na 1-pint Mason, jar, identical to the cooking-oil\nlamp pictured on page 102 of the Light chapter\nexcept for the substitution of a short candle for\nthe oil and wick. To make a stable candle base\non a glass jar\u0027s rounded bottom, cover it with\nhot candle wax. To be able to light the candle\nand then put it inside the glass jar, make tongs\noutofan 18-inchlengthofcoathangerwire bent\nin the middle, with each of its two ends bent\ninward 90 degrees and cut off to make 1/4-inch-\nlong candle grippers.\n*Thesecond-bestcandle-\nlamp is made by cutting a\nstandard aluminum pop or\nbeercan, as illustrated.

The first candle\nburned will saturate and\nthen hardenthe sand,mak-\ning a permanent candle\nbase or holder.\nCaution: Although candles are the safest\nnon-electric lights for shelter use, they produce\nenough carbonmonoxide to causeheadaches in\na poorly ventilated, long-occupied shelter.

Lee andW.E.\nStrope (1974; 117 pages), Report EGU 2981 of\nStanford Research Institute.\nFallout from the approximately 300 kiloton\nChinese test explosion shown in Fig. 1 caused\nmilk from cows that fed on pastures near Oak\nRidge, Tennessee and elsewhere to be contami-\nnatedwithradioiodine, althoughnotwithenough\nto be hazardous to health. However, this milk\ncontamination (up to 900 picocuries of radio-\nactive iodine per liter) and the measured dose\nratesfrom the gammaraysemittedfrom fallout\nparticles deposited in different parts of the\nUnited States indicate that trans-Pacific fallout\nfrom even an overseas nuclear war in which\n\u0022only\u0022two orthreehundredmegatons wouldbe\nexploded could result in tens of thousands of\nunpreparedAmericans sufferingthyroidinjury.\nUnprepared Americans do not have potassium\niodide, the very effective prophylactic medica-\ntion to prevent thyroid injury from radioiodine,\nandfew could getitduringthe severaldaysthat\nit would take trans-Pacific war fallout to reach\nthe United States. Fortunately, removal of even\na cancerous thyroid rarely is fatal to people\nblessed with modern medical facilities.\nOnly about 7,500 Americans (people living\nwithin a few miles of a nuclear power plant in\nTennessee) have been given prophylactic po-\ntassium iodide to keep in their homes. No\ngovernment organization has advised even\nAmericans living near other nuclear facilities\nto buy and keep any kind of prophylactic medi-\ncine to protect their thyroids in case of a peace-\ntime nuclear accident. As expected, official\nwarnings and advice to the public continue not\neven to mention preparations that individual\nAmericans could make to protect themselves\nand their families against thyroid injury either\nfrom trans-Pacific war fallout deposited on an\nAmerica at peace, or as a result of war fallout if\nour country is subjected to a nuclear attack.\nTheworstdangertoAmericansfrom trans-\nPacific fallout from a large nuclear war would\nbe the whole-body gamma radiation doses that\nmillions would receive from fallout particles\ndeposited on the ground, on streets, on and in\nbuildings. Protective countermeasures would\ninclude both sheltering some pregnant women\nand small children living in \u0022hot spot\u0022 areas of\nabnormally high rain-out of fallout, and evacu-\nating others. Unless such unavoidably time-\nconsuming and expensive countermeasures\nweretaken, severalthousand additionalAmeri-\ncans might die from cancer in the following 20\nor 30 years. The largest total doses would be\nreceived by people who would live normal\nunsheltered lives for the first month or so after\nfallout deposition, whilethe doserates wouldbe\nhighest.\nSeveral thousand additional cancer deaths\nwould be extremely difficult to detect, if caused\nby whole-body gamma radiation from fallout\ndeposited nationwide, with these scattered\ndeaths occurring over the 20 or 30 years follow-\ning a trans-Pacific war fallout disaster. For\nduring these same decades about 15 million\nAmericans normally would die from cancers\nindistinguishable from those caused by whole-\nbody radiation from warfallout depositedon an\nAmerica at peace.\nAn authoritative risk estimate of getting\ncancer from low doses of radiation is given in\nReport No. 77 (March 15, 1984) of the National\nCouncil on Radiation Protection and Measure-\nment, \u0022Exposures from the Uranium Series","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":159,"content":"with Emphasis on Radon and Its Daughters\u0022:\n\u0022The low dose model for total excess\ncancer mortality is one hundred cases\nper million people exposed to one rem\nuniform whole body radiation.

Very\nsmall particles in the stratosphere do not reach\nthegroundbeforethey areblownatleastseveral\nthousand miles. Most of these tiny particles\nremain airborne for weeks to years, are very\nwidely dispersed, and are blown around the\nworld several to many times before being de-\nposited. By then the radioactivity of iodine-131\n(that has a half life of only a little more than 8\ndays) is so greatly reduced that it is not nearly\nas dangerous as is radioactive iodine deposited\nmuch sooner with the fallout from smaller\nweapons of several hundred kilotons, or less,\nexplosive power.\n* Nuclear explosions smaller than about\nhalf a megaton (500 kilotons) inject all or most\nof their fallout to lower altitudes - within the\ntroposphere, below the stratosphere. Most of\nsuch fallout is deposited during the radioactive\ncloud\u0027sfirst world-circlingtrip, wheneven quite\nrapidlydecayingradioiodine stillisdangerous-\nlyradioactive.This greaterdangerfrpm smaller\nnuclearweapons has been provedby numerous\nmeasurements of fallout from many nuclear\ntest explosions, both foreign and American.\n\u2022 The dangers from trans-Pacific fallout pro-\nduced by peacetime nuclear accidents are not\nnearly as serious as many Americans have\nbeen led to believe. Forexample, the Chernobyl\nnuclearpowerreactoraccidentinjectedasmuch\nradioactiveiodineintothe atmosphere aswould\ntheexplosionsof severalkiloton-range nuclear\nweapons totaling perhaps as much as half a\nmegaton in explosive power. But not nearly as\nmuchoftheradioactivitycausedbythisreactor\naccident reached the United States as would\nreachus from severalnuclearexplosions inthe\nsame area, capableofinjectinganequalamount\nof radioactivity into the atmosphere, because:\n* The cloud from the steam explosion that\nblew off the roof and otherwise damaged the\nChernobyl reactor building, may have risen\nquite soon to 20,000 feet or more and was\npartially blown eastwardclear across Asia and\nthe Pacific Ocean. However, the top of the\nradioactive smoke cloud over the Chernobyl\npower plant, that burned for days, rose only\nabout 3,000 feet above the ground. As a result,\nmuchof theairborneChernobyIradiation stayed\nat relatively low altitudes where scavenging\n(removal) of smoke and fallout particles and\ngasses is mosteffectiveandrapid, dueto aggre-\ngation on cloud droplets, rain-out, and dry\ndeposition. In contrast, almost all ofthe fallout\nparticles andradioactive gassesfrom a nuclear\nexplosionare injectedmuchhigher,to altitudes\nwhere scavenging is less effective; there, the\ngenerallyprevailingwest-to-eastwindsprompt-\nly start transporting very small particles and\nradioactive gasses (that originate in the mid-\nlatitudes of the northern hemisphere) around\nthe world.\n* Variable winds for days carried much of\nthe Chernobyl radioactive material northward\nto Scandanavian countries, then westward and\nsouthward to other European countries. The\nresultant wide dispersal of this fallout allowed\ntimefor bothscavengingand radioactivedecay\nbefore a small fraction of these invisible radio-\nactivecloudsrose andalsowereblowneastward\nby the prevailing high-altitude winds. These\nwest winds carried an extremely smallfraction\nof the radioactive emissions from the burning\nChernobyl plant clear across Asia and the\nPacific to America.\n\u2022 The media habitually exaggerate dangers\nfrom nuclear accidents, and exploited the Cher-\nnobyl disaster. For example, when Dr. Robert\nGale, the leading bone marrow transplant spe-\ncialistwhohelpedsave a fewChernobylvictims,\nfirst returnedfrom Russia, an AssociatedPress\narticle quoted him as saying: \u0022I think we can\nsay there are at least 50,000 to 100,000 people","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":160,"content":"who have had some dose of radiation which\nmight be of long-term concern.

When digging \u0027earth that is too firm to shovel\nwithout first breaking it up, start picking (or\nbreaking with a shovel) in aline across the center\nof the trench.

To save time and work, SHARPEN ALL\nTOOLS AND KEEP THEM SHARP.\n6. Wear gloves from the start-even tough hands\ncan blister and become painful and infected after\nhours of digging.\n7. Check to be sure the earth is stable and firm\nenough so that a trench shelter with unshored\n(unsupported), vertical earth walls will be safe\nfrom cave-ins. (Interior doors are not strong\nenough to roof an earth-covered trench wider\nthan 3 ft.)\nAs a test of the stability of earth, dig a small\nhole about 18 in. deep. Remove all loose earth\nfrom the bottom of the hole. Then make a\n\u0022thumb test\u0022 by pushing your bare thumb into\nthe undisturbed surface at the bottom of the hole.\nIf you can push your thumb into the earth no\nfarther than one inch, the earth should be\nsuitable for this type of shelter. If the earth does\nnot pass the \u0022thumb test,\u0022 move to another\nlocation and try the test again. Continue to\nrelocate and repeat until suitable earth is\nfound, or build a shored-trench or aboveground\nshelter.\n8. Prepare to dig a vertical-walled trench41/2 ft deep\nand 3 ft wide. To determine the length of the\ntrench, add together the widths ofall the doors to\nbe used for roofingit, then subtract8in. from the\nsum. (To avoid arithmetical errors, it is best to\nlay all the doors side by side on the ground.)\n9. Clear any brush, grass, or weeds that are more\nthan a few inches high from the area where the\ntrench will be dug. Also clear the ground around\nall sides of the trench, to a distance of about 8ft\nfrom the sides and ends of the trench.\n10. Stake out a rectangular trench 36 in. wide, with\nits length as determined above. Also stake outthe\n.entrance at one end, as illustrated in Fig. A.l at\nthe end of Appendix A.l, and the ventilation\ntrench and opening at the other.\nII. Dig the main trench, the entryway trench, and\nthe ventilation trench. Place the excavated earth\nalong both lengthwise sides of the trench,\nstarting at the outside edges of the cleared space.\nBesure that no earth ispiled closer than 3ftto the\nsides of the trench.\n12.

Ifthe earthdoes not pass the test,\ndo not dig the trench any deeper; try another\nlocation.\n13. To keep each trench its full width as it isdug, cut\na stick 36 in. long and another 18 in. long; use\nthem repeatedly from the start to check the\nwidths ofthe main trench and the entry trenches.\nKeeping the trenches full width will save much\nwork and time later.\n14. Carefully level and smooth the ground to a\ndistance of 21/2 ft from the sides of the trench, so\nthat the doors will lie flat on the ground up to the\nedges of the trench.\n15. If plenty of sheets, bedspreads, plastic, and/or\nother materials are available, cover the trench\nwalls with them. Wall coverings should stop one\ninch from the floor of the trench to prevent their\nbeing stepped on and pulled down. Plastic wall\ncoverings keep some types of damp earth walls\nfrom drying out and crumbling.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":168,"content":"16. To be able to place an adequate thickness of\nshielding earth all the way to and around the\nentryway and ventilation hole, stack improvised\n\u0022sandbags\u0022 around these two openings before\nplacing the earth on the roof. Or use cloth or\nplastic material to make \u0022rolls\u0022 of earth, as\nillustrated in the introductory section of Appen-\ndix A.\n17. Shovel earth around the rolls, sandbags, or other\nmeans used to raise the level of the earth around\nthe two shelter openings. Slope this earth\noutward, and pack it, so that rainwater on the\nground cannot run into the shelter.\n18. To rainproof the shelter and to prevent the\nroofing doors from being dampened and\nweakened, use available waterproof materials as\nfollows:\na. If the earth is dry, the easiest and best way to\nmake a rainproof roof is to place the doors\u0027\ndirectly on the ground, with each of the end\ndoors overlapping an end of the main trench\nby 4 or 5 in. (Be sure again to levelthe ground\nsurface as you place each door, so that each\nlies flat against the ground all the way to the\nedges of the trench.) Next, mound dry earth\nover the doors. First place a few inches of\nearth on the doors near their.ends; then\nmound it about 12 in. deep above the\ncenterline of the trench. Slope the earth to\nboth sides so as to just cover the ends of the\ndoors. :\\ext. smooth off the earth mound.\nbeing careful to remove sharp stones that\nmight puncture rainproof materials. Then\nplace waterproof material over the smooth\nmound. making the \u0022buried roof\u0022 shown in\nFig. A.!. Finally, carefully mound an addi-\ntional 12to 15in. of earth on top of the buried\nroof. again placing it first over the doors near\ntheir ends. The earth over the trench should\nbe at least 2 ft thick. so that effective earth\narching will support most of the weight of the\nearth covering and will provide considerable\nprotection if struck by blast.\nb. If the earth is wet, place the waterproof\nmaterial directly on top of the doors, to keep\nthem dry and strong. To make water run off\nthis waterproof covering and to keep water\nfrom collecting on a horizontal surface and\nleaking through, slope the doors toward one\nside of the trench by first making one side of\nthe trench about 3 in. higher than the other\nside. A way to raise one side-s-without\nincreasing the distance the doors must\nspan-is to place an earth-filled \u0022roll\u0022 of\nbedsheets or other material along one edge of\nthe trench. To keep the waterproof material\nused to cover the doors from slidingdown the\nslope of the doors when earth is shoveled on,\ntuck the upper edge ofthe material under the\nhigher ends of the doors. Finally, mound\nearth over the doors. first placing it neartheir\nends. The mound should be at least 2 ft deep\nabove the centerline ofthe roofand about 3or\n4 in. deep over both ends of the doors.\nIf more waterproof material is available than\nis required to make a buried roof (or to cover\nthe doors) and to make the illustrated\ncanopies over the two shelter openings, use\nthis excess material to cover the wet ground\non which the doors are placed.\n19. Dig small drainage ditches around the completed\nshelter, to lead runoff water away.\n20. To keep rain and; or sand-like fallout particles\nfrom falling into the shelter openings, build an\nopen-sided canopy over each opening, as\nillustrated in Fig. A, shown in the introductory\nsectio.n of Appendix A.\n21. Install the air pump (a KAP) in the shelter\nopening into which air is already naturally\nmoving.\n22. If the shelter has a KAP, protection against\nradiation can be increased by placing containers\nof water and ofheavy foods, or bags of earth, so\nas to partially block the openings. This would\nstill permit adequate air to be pumped through\nthe shelter, except in very hot weather.\n23. For seats, place water and food containers,\nbedding, etc., along the side of the trench that is\nfarther from the off-center entry trenches. If the\ntrench floor is damp, covering it with a\nwaterproof material, tree limbs, or brush will\nhelp.\n24. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed with available materials.

If the site chosen is on a steep slope, locate the\nshelter with its length crosswise to the direction\nof the slope.\n8. Stake out the outlines of the trench, driving\nstakes as indicated in Fig. A.2.1 at the end of\nAppendix A.2. If more than 4 persons are to be\nsheltered, increase the length of the shelter room\nby 2 ft 9 in. for each additional person.\n9. Clear the ground of saplings and tall grass within\n10 ft of the staked outlines so that later the\nexcavated earth can be easily shoveled back onto\nthe completed shelter roof.\n10. Start digging, throwing the first earthabout 10ft\nbeyond the staked outlines of the trench. Less\nable members of the family should do the easier\ndigging, near the surface. Those members who\ncan use an ax and saw should cut and haul poles.\nSee the introductory section of this appendix for\nthe know-how to make this hard work easier.\nII. Pile all excavated earth at least 2 ft beyond the\nedges of the trench, so roofing poles can be laid\ndirectly on the ground. To make sure that the\n. trenches are dug to the specified full widths at the\nbottoms, cut and use two sticks-one 42 in. long\nand the other22 in. long-to check trench widths\nrepeatedly.\n12. At the far end of-the shelter dig the ventilation\ntrench-emergency exit, making it 22 in. wide and\n40 in. deep. This will help provide essential\nventilation and cooling. In cold weather or when\nfallout is descending, canvas or plastic curtains\nshould be hung in the two openings to controlthe\nair flow.\n13. Make and install threshold boards, to keep the\nedges of earth steps and earth ledges from being\nbroken off. (In damp earth, it is best to install\nthreshold boards before roofing the shelter.) If\nboards are lacking, use small poles.\n14. Unless the weather is cold, build a shelter-\nventilating pump-a KAP 20 in. wide X 36 in.\nhigh. (Ifthe weather is cold, building a KAP can\nbe safely delayed until after the shelter is\ncompleted.) A KAP should be made before a\ncrisis, or, if possible, before leaving home.\n15. Obtain fresh-cut green poles, or, as a second\nchoice, sound, dry, untreated poles. Useno poles\nsmaller in diameter than those specified in the\naccompanying drawings. For ease in hauling,\nselect poles no more than 50% larger in diameter\nthan those specified.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":172,"content":"16. Lay the poles side by side over the trench.\nAlternate the large and small ends to keep the\npoles straight across the trench. If roof poles 9 ft\nlong are being used to roof a 5-ft-wide trench, be\nsure to place the roof poles so that their ends\nextend 2 ft farther beyond one side of the trench\nthan beyond the other side. This will enable\nshelter occupants, after the stoop-in shelter is\ncompleted, to widen the shelter room 2 ft on one\nside. First. it can be widened to provide a 2-ft-\nwide sleeping ledge. Later, it can be further\ndeepened to make space for additional expedient\nhammocks or for double-bunk beds of poles or\nboards built on each side of the shelter.\n17. For ease and safety laterwhen hangingexpedient\nbedsheet-hammocks and bedsheet-chairs in the\ncompleted shelter, place loose loops around roof\npoles in the approximate locations given by the\ndiagram on the second shelter drawing, Fig.\nA.2.2.

Dig surface drainage ditches around the outside\nof the mounded earth and around the entrances.\n25. Place a piece of water-shedding material over\neach of the entrances, forming an open-ended\ncanopy to keep fallout and rain from the shelter\nopenings. (See Fig. A in the introductory section\nof Appendix A.) Almost all fallout would settle\non these suspended canopies, rather than falling\ninto shelter openings-or would fall off their\nedges and onto the ground like sand.\n26. Hangthe KAP from the roofof the trench opening\ninto which outdoor air can be felt flowing, so that\nair will be pumped in the direction of the natural\nflow of air. (If you have no KAP, make and\nuse a small Directional Fan.)\n27. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed- with available materials. If possible, disin-\nfect all water stored in expedient containers, using\none scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach, such as\nClorox, for each 10gallons of water. Even if only\nmuddy water is available, store it. If you do not\nhave a disinfectant, it may be possibleto boil water\u0027\nwhen needed.\n28. Put all of your emergency tools inside your\nshelter.\n29. As timeand materials permit, continue to improve\nyour chances ofsurviving by doing as many ofthe\nfollowing things as possible:\n(I) Make a homemade fallout meter,as described\nin Appendix C, and expedient lights.\n(Prudent people will have made these\nextremely useful items well ahead of\ntime.)\n(2) Makeand hangexpedient bedsheet-hammocks\nand bedsheet-chairs, following the installation\ndiagram shown in Fig. A.2.2.\n(3) Install screens or mosquito netting over the\ntwo openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a\nproblem. Remember, however, that screen or\nnetting reduces the air flow through a shelter\n- even when the air is pumped through with a\nKAP.\n(4) Dig a stand-up hole near the far end of the\nshelter. Make the hole about 15in. in diameter\nand deep enough to permit the tallest of the\nshelter occupants to stand erect occasionally.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":173,"content":"ORNL OW6 7\u0022-\u0022755~\nLeCZNQ:\nALU,.NA.T[ BIG IoI\u003EI:J ~u..

That is,a person in the open outside this shelter\nwill receive a gamma ray dose 1000times greaterthan\nhe will receive inside the shelter. See drawings at the\nend of Appendix A.3.\nAgainst blast: This shelter is excellent for pre-\nventingfatalities ifit isbuilt with strongexpedient blast\ndoors; it isstilIquitegood ifbuilt withoutthem. (These\ninstructionsare for fallout shelters. Theinstructionsfor\nmaking blast doors and other essentials for adequate\nblast protection are given in Appendix D.

For each\nadditional occupant beyond 12,add 1ft to the length\nof the shelter room.\nThis shelter requires less work and materials per\noccupant if its room is sized for about 24 persons,\nbecause the entrances are the same regardless of the\nlength of the room. (To make the shelter room twice\nas long, each ofthe horizontal, ladder-like braces on\nthe floor and near the ceilingofthe roomcan be made\nwith two poles on a side, rather than one long pole on\na side.)\nIf the room is sized for more than 24 people,\nmanagement and hygiene problems become more\ndifficult when it is occupied.\nFor 12people to live for manydays in this shelter\nwithout serious hardship, the benches and bunks\nmust be built with the dimensions and spacingsgiven\nin the illustration. Or, materials must be available for\nmaking and suspending 12 expedient bedsheet-\nhammocks that can be converted each day into 12\nbedsheet-chairs.\nBUILDING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Study both of the two drawings (Fig. A.3.1\nand A.3.2 at the end of Appendix A.3) and read\nall of these instructions before beginning\nwork. CHECK OFF EACH STEP WHEN\nCOMPLETED.\n2. By the time the shelter is finished, plan to have\ncompleted (1) a ventilating pump (a KAP 24 in\nwide and 36 in. high), essential except in cold\nweather, and (2) the storage of at least 15gallons\nof water per occupant.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":176,"content":"3.

A backhoe, chain saws, and\nother mechanized equipment would be helpful,\nbut not essential.)\n5. To help drain the floor, locate the shelter so that\nthe original ground level at the entrance isabout\n12 inches lower than the original ground level at\nthe far end of the shelter-unless the location is\nin a\u0027 very flat area.\n6. Stake out the trench for the entire shelter. Even\nin very firm ground, if the illustrated 12-person\nshelter is being built, make the excavation at the\nsurface 9 ft 8 in. wide and 18ft long (3 ft longer\nthan the entire length of the wooden shelter). The\nsloping sides of the excavation are necessary,\neven in very firm earth, to provide adequate\nspace for backfilling and tamping. (The trench\nillustrated in Fig. A.3.1 is 6 ft 4 in. deep, to\nminimize work when providing only for excellent\nfallout protection. For improved blast protec-\ntion, the trench should be at least 7 ft deep.)\n7. Check the squareness of the staked trench outline\nby making its diagonals equal.\n8. Clear all brush, tall grass, and the like from the\nground, to a distance of 10 ft all around the\nstaked location-so that later you can easily\nshovel loose earth back onto the roof.\n9.

Earth dug from 5 or 6 ft\nbelow ground levelthencan easily be piled on the\nsurface only I to 5 ft from the edge of the\nexcavation.\n12. Finish the bottom of the excavation so that it\nslopes vertically 1/2 in. per foot of length toward\nthe entrance, and also slopes toward the central\ndrain ditch. (Later, sticks covered with porous\nfabric should be placed in the ditches, to serve\nlike a crushed-rock drain leading to a sump.)\n13. While some persons are excavating, others\nshould be cutting green poles and hauling them\nto the site. Cut poles that have tops no smaller\nthan the specified diameters for eachtype of pole\n(not including the bark).\n14. For ease in handling poles, select wall and roof\npoles with top diameters no more than 50%\nlarger than the specified minimum diameters.\n15. Sort the poles by sizeand layall poles of the same\nsize together, near the excavation.\n16. Before the excavation IS completed, start\nbuilding the ladder-like, horizontal braces of the\nshelter frame. Construct these braces on smooth\nground near the excavation. Place two straight\npoles. each 10 ft 6 in. long (with small-end\ndiameters of 4 in.), on smooth ground, parallel\nand 6 ft 2 in. apart. Hold these poles securely so\nthai their outer sides are exactly 6 ft 2 in. apart,\nby driving two pairs of stakes into the ground so\nthat they just touch the outsides of the two long\npoles. Each of the four stakes should be located\nabout one foot from the end of a pole. To keep\nthe 10ft 6 in. poles from being rotated duringthe\nnext step. nail two boards or small poles across\nthem perpendicularly as temporary braces,\nabout 4 ft apart.\nThen with an ax or hatchet, slightly flatten the\ninner sides of the two poles at the spots where the\nends of the 6 cross-brace poles will be nailed.\n\u0022\u0027ext. saw each cross-brace pole to the length\nrequired to fit snugly into its place. Finally,\ntoenail each cross-brace pole in place, preferably\nwith two 40-penny nails in each end.\n17. Place the lower, ladder-like horizontal brace of\nthe main room on the floor of the completed\nexcavation.\n18. Build the frame of the main room. Near the four\ncorners of the room, secure four of its wall poles\nin their final vertical positions by nailing, wiring,\nor tying temporary brace-poles to the inner sides\nof these 4 wall poles and to the inner sides of the\ntwo long poles of the ladder-like horizontalbrace\non the bottomof the excavation. To keep the two\npairs of vertical wall poles exactly 6ft. 2in. apart\nuntil the upper ladder-like horizontal brace is\nsecured in its place, nail a temporary horizontal\nbrace across each pairof vertical poles, about I ft\nbelow their tops.\n19. To support the upper ladder-like horizontal\nbrace, nail blocks to the inner sides of the four\nvertical wall poles, as shown in the lower right-\nhand corner of the pictorial view, Fig. A.3.2. If\nyou have large nails, use a blockabout 3in. thick\nand 6 in. long, preferably cut from a green, 4-in.-\ndiameter pole.\n20\u00B7. In the finished shelter, DO NOT leave any\nvertical support poles under the long poles of the\nupper ladder-like horizontal brace; to do so\nwould seriously reduce the usable space alongthe\nwalls for benches, bunks, and occupants.\n21. While some workersare buildingthe frame of the\nmain room, other workers should make the four\nladder-like horizontal braces for the two en-\ntrances, then make the complete entrances. To\nkeep the ladder-like horizontal braces square\nduring construction and back-filling, nail a\ntemporary diagonal brace across each one.\n22. When the four wall poles and the two ladder-like\nhorizontal braces of the main room are in place,\nput the remaining vertical wall poles in place,\ntouching each other, until all walls are com-\npleted. When placing the wall poles, keep them\nvertical by alternately putting a butt and a top\nend uppermost. Wall poles can be held In\nposition by backfilling and tamping about a foot\nof earth against their lower ends, or they can be\nwired in position until backfilled.\n23. Besure to use the two 5-in.-diameter poles (6 ft 2\nin. long) by placing one next to the top and the\nother next to the bottom of each of the main\ndoorways to the room. Study the drawings. Use\nbraces, each 2 ft 3 in. long, to hold apart the top\nand bottom of each doorway-thus making sure\nthat a 24-in.-wide air pump can swing in either\ndoorway.\n24. To prevent earth from coming through the\ncracks between wall poles; cover the walls with","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":178,"content":"cloth, plastic, rugs, roofing, or even cardboard. If\nnone of these are available, use sticks, twigs, or\ngrass to cover the wider cracks.\n25. After all horizontal bracing and vertical wall\npoles are in place, begin backfilling, puttingearth\nbetween the walls and trench sides. Pay particu-\nlar attention to the order of filling. The earth fill\nbehind all the walls must be brought up quite\nevenly, so that the earth fill behind one side is no\nmore than 12 in. higher at anyone time than the\nearth on the opposite side. Lightly tamp theearth\nfill in 6-in. layers. A pole makes a good tamper;\ndo not use a mechanical tamper.\n26. Next, lay the roof poles side by side, touching\neach other on top ofthe wall poles. Coverat least\nthe larger cracks with plastic, roofing, boards, or\nsticks to keep earth from falling through. If the\nearth is sandy, cover the whole roof with some\nmaterial such as bedsheets or plastic to keep\nsand from running through the cracks.\nCAUTION: Do not try to rainproofthis flat roof\nand simply cover it with earth. If you do, water\nwill seep straight through the loose earth cover,\npuddle on the flat roofing material, and leak\nthrough the joints between pieces of roofing\nmaterial or through small holes.\n27. Mound earth over the shelter, piling it about 15\nin. deep along the centerline of the roof and\nsloping it toward the sides of the roof, so that the\nearth is only about 2 in. deep over the ends ofthe\nroof poles. (Preparatory to moundingearth onto\nthe roof, place gradestakes in position so you will\nbe able to know the locations and depths of roof\npoles as you cover them.) Continue these slopes\nto two side drainage ditches. Smooth this\nmounded earth with a rake or stick and remove\nany sticks or rocks likely to puncture the\nrainproof roofing material to be laid on it.\n28. Place rainproofing material on top of the\nsmooth, mounded earth-as shown in sections of\nthe drawings in Fig. A.3.l--to make a \u0022buried\nroof.\u0022 Plastic film, such as 4-mil polyethylene, is\npreferable. Roofing material, plastic shower\ncurtains and tablecloths, or canvas can also be\nused. Be sure to overlap adjoining pieces.\n29. Place the rest of the earth cover over the shelter,\nbeing sure that the corners of the shelter have at\nleast 21/2 ft of earth over them. Mound the dirt,\nsmoothing its surface so that water will tend to\nrun off to the surface drainage ditches which\nshould be dug all around the edges of the\nmounded earth.\n30. Build the benches and overhead bunks. Ifboards\nare available, use them; if not, use small, straight\npoles. On each side, build a row of benches and\nbunks 9 ft long, centered in the shelter. In order\nto use the shelter space to the greatestadvantage,\nmake the heights and widths of the benches and\nbunks the same as the thoroughly tested heights\n(14 in. and 4 ft 5 in.) and widths (16 in. and 24 in.)\ngiven by Fig. A.3.2. Also be sure to space their\nvertical supports 3 ft apart-so two adults can sit\nbetween each pair of vertical bunk supports.\n31. Narrow the ends of the overhead bunks so that\nthe aisle between them is about 28 in. wide for a\ndistance of38 in. from each doorway. This allows\nroom for installation and operation of an\nexpedient air pump (a KAP) for prevention of\ndangerous overheating in warm weather.\n32. Place a canopy (open on all sides) over each\nentrance, to minimize the entry of sand-like\nfallout particles or rain.\n33. To improve the floor, lay small poles between the\nlower brace poles, so that the floor is approxi-\nmately level. Or, use sticks covered with scrap\nboards.\n34. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed with available materials. If possible,\ndisinfect all waterstored in expedientcontainers,\nusing one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,\u0027\nsuch as Clorox, for each 10 gallons of water.\nEven ifonly muddy water isavailable, store it.

Pictorial Viewof Small-Pole Shelter.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":182,"content":"Appendix A.4\nAboveground, Door-Covered Shelter\nPROTECTION PROVIDED\nAgainst fallout radiation: Protection Factor\nabout 200 (PF 200) ifcovered with 30 in. of earth. (A\nperson in the open outside this shelter would receive\nabout 200times more fallout radiation than ifhe were\ninside.) The drawing at the end of Appendix A.4\nshows the earth cover only 20 in. thick, resulting in a\nPF of about 100.\nAgainst blast: Better protection than most\nhomes. Blast tests have indicated that this shelter\nwould be undamaged at least up to the 5-psi\noverpressure range from large explosions. Without\nblast doors the shelter\u0027soccupants could be injured at\nthis overpressure range, although probably not\nfatally.\nAgainst fire: Fair, if the cloth in the entries is\ncovered with mud and if the shelter is sufficiently\ndistant from fires producing carbon monoxide and\ntoxic smoke.\nWHERE PRACTICAL\nIn a location where at leastone hollow-core\ndoor per occupant is available, where a dry\ntrench at least 14inchesdeepcan bedug without\ndifficulty, butthe watertableorrock istooclose\nto the surface for a covered-trench shelter to be\npractical. (A family evacuating in a pickup\ntruck or large station wagon can carry enough\ndoors, with doorknobs removed. Strong boards\nat least 6 feet long and at least one full inch\nthick, or plywood at least3/4-inch thick, also can\nbe used to roof this shelter and to support its\noverhead earth shielding.\nWarning: Somedoors with single-thickness\npanels if loaded with earth will break before\nthey bend enough to result in protective earth\narching.\nFOR WHOM PRACTICAL\nFor a typical family orothergroup withtwo\nor more members able to work hard for most of\n36 hours. Very littlebuildingskill isneeded. (An\nurban family of six, with 14- and 12-year-old\nsons and 13- and 9-year-old daughters, com-\npleted this shelter, sized for six persons, in one\nlongworkingday: 13hours and43 minutes after\nreceiving the step-by-step, will illustrated in-\nstructions at their Florida home 10 miles from\nthe rural building site. This family used its\npickup truck to carry them, the interior doors,\nand other survival items.)\nCAPACITY\nThe shelter illustrated in Fig. A.4 is the\nminimum length for 4 persons. It is roofed with 6\ndoors.\nFor each additional person, add another door.\n(If more than about 7 persons are to be sheltered,\nbuild 2 or more separate shelters.)\nBUILDING INSTRUCTIONS\n1. Before beginning work, study the drawing and\nread ALL of the following instructions. Divide the\nwork so that some will be digging while others are\nbuilding an air pump, storing water, etc. CHECK\nOFF EACH STEP WHEN COMPLETED.\n2. By the time the shelter is finished, plan to have\ncompleted a ventilating pump (a 16-in.-wide by 24-\nin.-high KAP-essential except in cold weather) and\nthe storage of 15gallons of water per occupant. (See\nAppendix B and Chapter 8.)\n3. Start to assemble the materials and tools needed.\nFor the illustrated 4-person shelter, these are:\nA. Essential Materials and Tools\n\u2022 Six doors. Boards or plywood at least 5/8_\nin. thick can be used to replace one or more of\nthe doors.\n\u2022 At least 4 double-bed sheets for each of\nthe first four persons, and 3 double-bed\nsheets for each additional person to be\nsheltered-or enough pieces of fabric and/or\nof plastic to cover at least as large an area as\nthe sheets would cover. (This material is for\nmaking aboveground shelter walls, to serve\nas sand bags.)\n\u2022 Rainproofing materials (plastic film,\nshower curtains, plastic tablecloths, mattress\nprotectors,etc.)-I5square yards for the first\n4 persons and 21/2 square yards for each\nadditional person.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":183,"content":"\u2022 A shovel (one shovel for each two\nworkers isdesirable). Apick or mattock ifthe\nground is very hard.\n\u2022 A knife (the only essential tool for\nmaking a small shelter-ventilating KAP) and\nmaterials for a KAP 16 in. wide and 24 in.\nhigh. (See Appendix 8.)\n\u2022 Containers for storing water. (See\nChapter 8.)\nB. UsefulMaterials andTools\n\u2022 Two or more buckets, large cans and/or\nlarge pots with bail handles-s-to carry earth,\nand later to store water or wastes.\n\u2022 Saw (or ax or hatchet)-to cut a few\nboards or small poles.\n\u2022 Hammer and at least 15 small nails (at\nleast ih in. long).\n\u2022 Tape measure, yardstick,or ruler.\n\u2022 Additional cloth and/or plastic-equiv-\nalent in size to 2 more double-bed sheets for\neach person.\n\u2022 Additional waterproof material-2\nmore square yards per person.\n\u2022 Pillowcases, or cloth or plastic bags-to\nserve as earth-filled sand bags. The more, the\nbetter.\n4. To save time and work, sharpen all tools and\nkeep them sharp.\n5. Wear gloves from the start, to help prevent.\nblisters and infections.\n6. Select a building site where there is little or no\nchance of the ground being covered with water,\nand where the water table (groundwater level) is\nnot likely to rise closer than 18 inches to the\nsurface.\n7. To avoid the extra work of diggingamong roots,\nselect a site away from trees, if practical.\n8. To lessen the dangers of fire and smoke from\nnearby houses or trees that might catch fire,\nlocate your shelter as far as is practical from\nhouses and flammable vegetation.\n9. Before staking out your shelter, provide one door\nper person to roof the main room plus one\nadditional door for each of the two entries. Be\nsure the door knobs have been removed. Use the\ntwo widest doors to roof the entries.\n10. To be sure that all the walls will be in the proper\npositions to be roofed with the available doors,\nlay all the doors on the ground, touching each\nother and in the same relative positions they will\nhave when used to roofthe shelter. When all the\nroof doors are on the ground, side by side,\ndetermine the exact length of the shelter room.\n(Note that Fig. A.4 illustrates a shelter sized for\nonly 4 persons.)\n11. Stake out the shelter.\n12. Make the earth-filled \u0022rolls\u0022 that will form the\naboveground walls of your shelter. To make\nwalls out\u0027 of the rolls:\n(I) Use doors as vertical forms to hold the\nearth-filled rolls in place until the walls are\ncompleted. (These are the same doors that\nyou will use later to roof the shelter.)\n(2) Brace the door-forms with 36-in.-Iong\nbraces (boards or sticks) that press against\nthe doors, as shown in Fig. AA. Nail only\nthe upper braces, using only very small\nnails.\n(3) After the forms for the two inner sides of the\nshelter have been finished, put parts of the\nlong sides of bedsheets on the ground, as\nillustrated. (Or use other equally wide,\nstrong cloth or plastic material.) About a 2-\nft width of cloth should be on the ground,\nand the rest of each sheet should be folded\nup out of the way, over the outsides of the\ndoor-forms. Adjacent sheetsshould overlap\nabout 1ft when making a roll than islonger\nthan one sheet.\n(4) Shovel earth onto the parts of the sheet on\nthe ground to the height of the rolls you are\nmaking, as shown. Note that the roll to be\nmade on one side is2in. higherthan the roll\non the other side.\n(5) Shape the surface of the shoveled-on earth\nas illustrated, to hold the \u0022hooks\u0022 of cloth\nto be formed when the exposed sides of the\nsheets are folded down.\n(6) Fold down the upper side of each sheet\nwhile pulling on it to keep it tight and\nwithout wrinkles. It should lie on the","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":184,"content":"prepared earth surface, including the small\nnarrow trench, as illustrated in the first\nsection of this appendix.\n(7) Pack earth onto the partofthe folded-down\nsheet that is in the narrow, shallow trench.\nThen, as shown in the sketches at the\nbottom of the accompanying drawing, fold\nback the loose edge over this small amount\nof packed earth to form a \u0022hook.\u0022 (The\nhook keeps the weight of the earth inside a\nroll from pulling the cloth out of its proper\nposition.)\n(8) Make a roll first on one side of the shelter,\nthen on the other, to keep the heights of the\nearth on both sides of the shelter about\nequal. This will keep the unequal heights of\nearth from pushing the door-forms out of\ntheir vertical positions.\n(9) Add additional earth on top of the rolls so\nthat the height ofthe level earthsurface, out\nto the full width of a roll, isthe same as the\nheight of the cloth-covered part of the roll\nthat is against the door-form.\n(10) When the roll walls have been raised to their\nplanned heights on both sides ofthe shelter,\nremove the braces and the door-\nforms-being careful to keep the brace nails\nfrom damaging the doors.\n(II) The door-forms of the side-walls of the\nshelter can be removed before building the\nend-walls.\n13. When smoothing the earth surfaces of the final\ntops of the roll walls on both sides, check to see\nthat they have the sameslopeas the lowersides of\nthe roof doors will have after they are placed on\nthe roll walls. (A slope is necessary so that\nrainwater reaching the waterproofcovering to be\nplaced over the doors will run offthe lower side.)\nStudy Fig. AA.\n14. After the side-walls have been completed (except\nfor their ends that form the sides ofan entry) and\nafter the door-forms have been removed, use the\nsamedoors for forms to build the two 22-in.-wide\nentries.\n15. Useearth-filled \u0022sand bags\u0022(made ofpillowcases\nor sacks, and/or the tucked-in ends of earth-\nfilled rolls) to make the outer ends of each\nentryway.\n16. Make the two doorway frames if lumber, nails,\nand a saw areavailable. Makeeach frame as high\nas the wall on each side of it, and slope the top\nboard of each frame so that it will press flat\nagainst the doorto be supported. (Ifmaterialsfor\na frame are lacking, place a single 2 by 4-in.\nboard-or a poleabout 6ft.long-across the top\nof the entry, in the position shown in Fig. AAfor\nthe top of the doorway frame.)\n17. After carefully removing all the temporary\nbraces from the door-forms and the doors\nthemselves, improve the slopes of the tops of all\nsupporting walls so that the doors will be\nsupported evenlyand, without beingtwisted, will\nmake contact with the smooth, sloping earth or\ncloth.upon which they will rest.\n18. If more than enough waterproof plastic or\nsimilar material is available to cover all the roof\ndoors, also cover the tops of the walls on which\nthe roof doors will rest. This will keep the doors\nfrom absorbing water from damp earth.\n19. Dig the illustrated 14-in.-deep, 36-in.-wide\ntrench inside the shelter. (Ifthe water table istoo\nhigh to dig down 14 in., in some locations the\nwalls can be raised to a height of 38in. by cutting\nturf sods and laying them on top of the walls.\nAnother way the wall height can be increased is\nby making additional rolls.)\n20. Place the roof doors in their final positions, and\ncover them with waterproof material (if avail-\nable). Be sure the waterproof material is folded\nunder the higher edges ofthe doors-to keep the\nmaterial from slipping downward on the sloping\ndoors as earth is shoveled onto the roof.\n21. Extend the waterproof material on top of the\ndoors a couple of feet beyond the lower ends of\nthe doors-if enough material is available to\ncover all of the roof doors.\n22. When shoveling the first layer of earth onto the\nrainproof material protecting the doors, avoid\nhitting and possibly puncturing it with rocks or\nsharp pointed roots in the earth.\n23. To make earth arching more effective m\nsupporting most of the earth to be placed on the\nroof doors, first mound earth on and near the\nends of the doors.\n24. Cover the roof with at least 20 in. ofearth. Make\nsure that there also is a thickness of at least 20 in.\nof earth at the corners of both the room and\nentries.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":185,"content":"25. To prevent surface water from running into the\nshelter if it rains hard, mound packed earth\nabout 5 in. high just inside the two entries. Rain\ncan be kept out by a small canopy or awningthat\nextends 2 or 3 ft in front ofthe outermostedge of\na doorway that roofs an entry.\n26. If any waterproof material remains, use it to\ncover the floor of the shelter.\n27. If the weather iswarm or hot, install a 16-in.-wide\nby24-in.-high air pump(a KAP). Attach its hinges\nto the board across the roofofthe entry into which\noutside air is moving naturally at the time. (If\nshortof time ormaterials for a KAP, make a\nsmall Directional Fan.)\n28. Cover all exposed combustible material with\nmud, earth, or otherfireproofmaterial, to reduce\nthe chance of exposed cloth being ignited from a\nnuclear explosion or heat from a nearby fire.\n29. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed with available materials. If possible,\ndisinfect all water stored inexpedientcontainers,\nusing one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,\nsuch as Clorox, for each IO gallons of water.\nEven if only muddy water is available, store it.

Wear gloves from the start-even tough hands\ncan blister after hours of digging and chopping\nand can become painful and infected.\n7. Select a shelter location where there is little\nchance of the ground being covered with waterif\nit rains hard. (Ifyou are sure the water table will\nnot rise to cover the floor of a shallow\nexcavation, you can save work by first lowering\nthe area of the planned main room by a foot or\ntwo. After the shelter is roofed, the excavated\nearth can be shoveled back to help cover the\ncompleted pole roof.) To avoid the extra work of\ncutting roots when excavatingearth, select a site\nat least as far away from a tree as the tree istall.\n8. For ashelter that is completely aboveground,\nclear grass. weeds, etc. from the area where the\nshelter is to be built. (This reduces the possible\nproblem of chiggers, ticks, etc.) Do not remove\nany earth at this stage.\n9. Stake out the entire shelter. Check the square-\nness of the shelter room by making its diagonals\nequal. Then drive two lines of stakes to mark the\noutside edges of the completed earth covering.\nPlace these stakes 4ft outside the future positions\nof the lower ends of the roof poles.\n10. Check the squareness of the future floor area\ninside the two lines marking where the\ntwo V-shaped, 4-in.-deep trenches will be dug,\nto secure the lower ends of the sloping side-poles\nof the room. These two parallel lines are 14ft 6\nin. apart. When the two diagonals joining the\nends of these two parallel lines are equal in\nlength, the area between them has square\ncorners.\nII. While some persons are staking out the shelters,\nothers should be cutting green poles and hauling\nthem to the site. Cut poles that have tops with\ndiameters (excluding bark) no smaller than the\ndiameters specified on the illustration for each\ntype of pole.\n12. To make the hauling and handling of the longer\npoles easier, select poles with top diameters no\nmore than 50% larger than the specified\nminimum diameters.\n13. Sort the poles by length and diameter and lay all\npoles of each size together, near the excavation.\n14. AS SOON AS POLES ARE BROUGHT TO\nTHE SITE, SOME WORKERS SHOULD\n.START BUILDING THE FOUR LADDER-\nLIKE HORIZONTAL BRACES FOR THE\nENTRYWAYS-TO AVOID DELAYS LAT-\nER. Study the drawing. Then construct these\nbraces on smooth ground near the excavation.\nPlace two straight poles, each 8 ft long (with\nsmall-end diameters of 31/2 in.), on smooth\nground, paralleland so that theiroutersides are 3\nft apart. Hold these poles securely so that their\nouter sides are exactly 3 ft apart, by driving two\npairs of stakes into the ground so that they just\ntouch the outsides of the two long poles. Each of\nthe four stakes should be located about one foot\nfrom the end of a pole. To keep the 8-ft poles\nfrom being rotated duringthe next step, nail two\nboards or small poles across them perpen-\ndicularly, as temporary braces, about 4 ft apart.\nThen with an ax or hatchet, slightly flatten\nthe inner sides of the two poles at the spots where\nthe ends of the 4 cross-brace poles will be nailed.\nNext, saw each cross-brace pole to the length\nrequired to fit snugly into its place. Finally,\ntoenail each cross-brace pole in place, preferably\nwith two large nails in each end.\n15. If more than 5 persons are to be sheltered, use 3\ncolumn-posts for 6 to 9 persons, and 4 column-\nposts for 10 to 14 persons.\n16. For each additional person beyond 5, make the\nridgepole and the footing log each I foot longer\nthan shown in Fig. A.5.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":190,"content":"17. After notching the footing log (see drawing),\nplace it in a trench dug deep enough so that the\nbottoms of its notches are about 4 inches below\nthe surface of the ground.\n18. Carefully dig the 4-in.-deep, V-shaped, straight\ntrenches in which the lower ends of the 9-ft wall\npoles will rest. Dig each of these two parallel\ntrenches 7 ft. 3 in. from the center line of the\nfooting log.\n19. Carefully notch a \u0022V\u0022 only about l/rin. deep in\nthe top of each of the two outer column-posts.\nThen saw off the other ends so that each is 4 ft.\n3 in. long. (When they are placed on the notched\nfooting log and the ridgepole is placed on them,\nthe upper side of the ridgepole will be about 4 ft\n4 in. above the ground.)\n20. Place the two outer column-posts in their\nnotches in the footing log, and secure the base of\neach column-postagainst sideways movement by-\nplacing two small-diameter, 4-ft horizontal poles\njust below the ground level on both sides, as\nillustrated. Then temporarily place and bracethe\nridgepole in position.\n21. For shelters sized for more than 5 occupants,\nmake and place the inner column-post, or posts.\nTo avoid cutting a \u0022V\u0022\u003Cnotched column-post too\nshort, first carefully \u0022V\u0027vnotch each remaining\ncolumn-post, cut it about I in. too long, and trim\nit off to fit in its final position under the\nridgepole.\n22. If nails at least 4 in. long are available, nail\nsloping cross-braces to the inner sides of the\ncolumn-posts. If nails are not available, notch\nslightly bowed cross-braces and the column-post\nas illustrated; then lash or wire them in position.\n(Strips of ordinary bedsheets, torn about a foot\nwide and twisted together slightly, can be made\nto serve as lashing \u0022rope.\u0022) To hold the tops of\nthe column-posts securely against the upperends\nof the cross-braces, a tightened \u0022rope\u0022loop that\nencircles the tops of the column-posts can be\nused.\n23. Next put four of the larger-diameter, 9-ft roof-\npoles in position, with the outsides of the\noutermost two roof poles each only about I in.\nfrom an end of the ridge pole.\n24. Place the rest of the 9-ft roof-poles in position,\nmaking sure that all their small ends are\nuppermost, and that they are pressed together\nand overlap on the ridgepole at least as far as\nillustrated. Pack earth between their lower ends.\nIf the earth is clay, put small spacers of wood\nbetween the ends.\n25. At each end of the shelter room, build extra\nshelter space and an entryway. Firstposition two\n14-ft poles with their upper ends resting on the\noutermost wall poles. Study Fig. A.5. Place the\ntwo 14-ft poles 20 in. apart, parallel, and equally\ndistant from the centerline of the ridgepole. Nail\nfour 20-in.-Iong spacer-poles between each pair\nof 14-ft poles, as illustrated. To make sure that\nthe upperends do not move beforeearth pressure\nholds them in place, tie the upperends of the 14-ft\npoles together. Drive a stake against the lower\nend of each 14-ft pole, to keep it from slipping\noutward. Under the center of each 14-ft pole,\nplace two supporting, vertical posts.\n26. Dig. 4-in.-deep trenches for the lower ends of the\nsloping end-wall poles of the main room. These\npoles must be cut to length so that their upper\nends will be about 4 in. above the outermost 9-ft\nroof pole against which they lean. Dig narrow,\nvertical trenches, about 8 in. deep, for all vertical\nwall poles that do not press against horizontal\nbrace poles near the ground.\n27. Start\u00B7 placing the sloping end-wall poles. First\nplace the longest pole, thenthe shorterpoles-all\ntouching.\n28. Across the open spaces between the 9-ft roof\npoles, place limbs andz or sticks roughly hori-\nzontally, as shown in the lower left-hand\ndrawing. Be sure to use limbs or sticks that have\ndiameters of at least 1/2 in. and put them no\nfarther apart than 6 in. Leave needles and leaves\non the limbs. Do not leave sharp ends sticking\nupward. Do not place more than a 6-in.-thick\nmass of limbs and leaves over the side-poles. The\nthickness of the earth cover necessary for\nexcellent fallout protection might be uninten-\ntionally reduced by making the limb cover too\nthick.\n29. Place bedsheets (or 4-mil-thick polyethylenefilm\nor equally sturdy material) over the limbs and\nsticks to keep earth from falling through the roof.\n30. To prevent sand or dry earth from falling\nbetween the cracks where the poles are side by\nside, cover these parts of the roof with cloth,\nplastic, or paper. If these materials are not","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":191,"content":"available, use sticks, leaves, and grass. (In tick or\nchigger season, avoid using grass. or leaves from\non or near the ground.)\n31. After the entryways are completed, begin to\ncover the shelter with earth. Starting from the\nground up, put on a full l-ft thickness of earth\ncover. First raise its height about a foot on one\nside or end of the shelter, and then on the\nother-repeatedly. This is to prevent unequal\nloading from tipping the shelter or pushing it\nover. (Do not excavate any earth closer than 3ft\nto the line of stakes marking the final outer edge\nof the completed, 2-ft-thick earth cover.)\n32. Fill the spaces between the entryways and the\nmain room only with earth. (An equal thickness\nof wood or other light material provides much\nless protection against radiation.)\n33. Before placing the rainproofing material for the\n\u0022buried roof,\u0022 smooth the surface of the i-n-\nthick earth cover. This will prevent sharp rocks\nor sticks from puncturing the plastic or other\nrainproofing material. If you do not have\nsufficient waterproofing materials to cover the\nwhole roof, use what isavailable to rainproofthe\ncentral part, on both sides of the ridgepole.\n34. To prevent rainwateron the ground outsidefrom\nrunning into the entryways, make mounds of\npacked earth about 4 inches high across the\nentryway floors, about 2ft from theirouterends.\nDig a shallow drainage ditch completely around\nthe earth mounded over the shelter.\n35. Unless the weather is cold, install your shelter-\nventilating KAP in the entry into which you can\nfeel air moving naturally. (If short of time or\nmaterials, make a small Directional Fan.)\n36. Complete the storage of water and other\nessentials.\n37. To prevent fallout or rain from falling onto the\nfloor of the outer entryways, place a small\nawning (not illustrated) over each opening.\n38. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed with available materials. If possible,\ndisinfect all waterstored inexpedient containers,\nusing one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,\nsuch as Clorox, for each 10 gallons of water.\nEven if only muddy water isavailable, store it. If\nyou do not have a disinfectant, itmay be possible\nto boil water when needed.\n39. Put all of your emergency tools inside your\nshelter.\n40. Astime and materials permit, continueto improve\nyour chances of surviving by doing as many of the\nfollowing things as possible:\n(I) Make a homemadefallout meter, as described\nin Appendix C, and expedient lights.\n(Prudent people will have made these\nextremely useful items well ahead of\ntime.)\n(2) Makeand hangexpedientbedsheet-hammocks.\n(3) Install screens or mosquito netting over the\ntwo openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a\nproblem. Remember, however, that screen or\nnetting reduces the air flow through a shelter\n- even when the air ispumped through with a\nKAP.\n(4) Dig a stand-up hole near the far end of the\nshelter. Make the holeabout 15in. indiameter\nand deep enough to permit the tallest of the\nshelter occupants to stand erect occasionally.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":192,"content":"cur LOwE,R ENO.s\n- - OF PQLe~ OFF\nAeoUT SQUARf!\n\u00BB:\nlH -8 \u0027....

(A person in the open outside this\nshelter would receive about200 times as much fallout\nradiation as he would if inside.) If earth is mounded\nto the top of the walls and 3 ft deep over the roof, the\nprotection factor can be raised to PF 500 or better.\nSee the accompanying drawing at the end of\nAppendix A.6.\nAgainst blast: Better protection than most\nhomes. Without blast doors, occupants could be\ninjured-although probably not fatally-at lower\noverpressure ranges than those that would destroy\nthis shelter.\nAgainst fire: Poor, if the shelter is built as\nillustrated. The cloth and outer poles would be\nunprotected from thermal pulse and other possible\nsources of intense heat. However, ifearth ismounded\naround the walls so as to cover all exposed cloth and\nwood, good fire protection would be provided.\nWHERE PRACTICAL\nThe crib-walled shelter is practical in many\nwooded areas and whenever enough poles are\navailable, or in locations where belowground\nexpedient shelters are impractical because the water\ntable or rock is too close to the surface for a covered-\ntrench shelter.\nFOR WHOM PRACTICAL\nFor a family or group with three or more\nmembers able to work very hard for most of48 hours.\nAn unskilled family with an ax or saw and materials\nfound in most American homes can build this shelter.\nNo nails are required. (Groups with the nails, tools,\nskill, and the number of workers required to build a\nRidgepoleShelterare advised to do so; a Crib-Walled\nShelter requires almost twice the total length of poles\nand more work to provide shelter for a given number\nof persons.)\nCAPACITY\nThe shelter illustrated in Fig. 6.1 isthe minimum\nlength for 5 persons. For each additional person, add\nIlh ft to the length of the room. (If more than about\n12 persons are to be sheltered, build 2 or more\nseparate shelters.)\nBUILDING INSTRUCTIONS\nI. Before beginning work, study the drawing and\nread ALL of the following instructions.\n2. Divide the work. CHECK OFF EACH STEP\nWHEN COMPLETED.\n3. By the time the shelter is finished, plan to have\ncompleted a ventilatingpump (a KAP 20in. wide\nand 26 in. high, essential for this shelterexcept in\ncool weather) and the storage of at least 15\ngallons of water per occupant. (See Appendix B\nand Chapter 8.)\n4. Start to assemble materials and tools.\nA. Essential Materials and Tools\n\u2022 Poles. (Fresh-cut, green poles are best;\nsound, untreated poles are satisfactory.)

If the building site is near the edge of a woods,\npick a site at least 40 ft from the nearest trees-to\navoid roots.\n9. Clear off grass, weeds, etc., from the area where\nyou plan to build the shelter-this also will help\nto avoid chiggers or ticks. Do not remove any\nearth.\n10. Stake out the entire shelter, locating the 6\nrequired cribs. BE SURE TO MAKE THE\nINSIDE LENGTH OF THE MAIN ROOM\nEQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF PERSONS\nTO BE SHELTERED MULTIPLIED BY Illz\nFT. The illustrated shelter issized for 5 persons,\nand the poles listed are those required for this\n5-person shelter.\nII. While some persons are staking out the shelter,\nothers should be cutting green poles and hauling\nthem to the site. Cut poles with tops no smaller\nthan the diameters specified. (Note: the specified\ndiameters do not include bark.)\n12. Select poles with small-end diameters no more\nthan 509C larger than the specified minimum\ndiameters. to make handling of the longwall and\nroof poles easier.\n13. Sort the poles by length and diameter and lay ail\npoles of each size together. near the excavation.\n14. Use larger trees and poles, up to 6in. in diameter,\nto make the 31\nz-ft-Iong end-poles of the cribs\n(Fig. A.6). Do not use poles with small-end\ndiameters of less than 3 in. for the side-wall poles\nof the cribs. For vertical brace-poles, use poles\nwith diameters of at least 2 in., cut off at the\nheight of the upper side of the uppermost\nhorizontal poles against which they are tied.\n15. Be sure to cut off all limbs so that the poles are\nquite smooth. Usually it IS easier to drag\nsmoothed poles to the buildingsite before cutting\nthem into the required lengths. Pull them by the\nsmall, lighter ends.\n16. Determine ifthere areenough long poles to make\nthe side-poles of the two cribs forming the sides\nof the shelter room without splicing two shorter\npoles together. If the shelter is being built for\nmore than 7persons. it will require side poles that\nare longer than 151\n2 ft. Therefore. if a shelter for\nmore than 7 persons is being built. it would be\nbest to use 2 cribs placed end-to-end on each side\nof the shelter room. instead of a single crib as\nillustrated by Fig. A.6.\n17. Place the lowermost four poles of each of the\ncribs in their final positions, so that all the bases\nof the crib-walls are in position on the ground.\nUse the thicker, heavier poles at and near the\nbottom ofeach crib. BE SURE THE ROOM IS\nLONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE Il(z FT OF\nROOM LENGTH FOR EACH PERSON TO\nBE SHELTERED.\n18. To build each crib:\n(I) Place two 311z-ft end-poles on the ground.\nPut two of the side-poles on top of the two\nend-poles so that the ends of all four poles\nextend 3 in. (no more) beyond where they\ncross. The thicker poles should be used first\nto add stability.\n(2) Stack additional pairs of end-poles and side-\npoles to form the crib, keeping each wall of\nthe crib vertical, until the tops of the\nuppermost side-poles areat least42 in. above\nthe ground. To keep the uppermost poles of\nthe crib about level while the crib is being\nraised, alternate the large ends and small\nends of poles.\n(3) Place a pair of small, vertical brace-poles in\neach of the four corners ofthe crib. The tops\nof the vertical brace-poles should be no\nhigher above the ground than the uppersides\nof the crib\u0027s uppermost horizontal poles.\n(4) Tie each pair ofvertical brace-poles together\ntightly at bottom, middle, and top. Fortying,\nuse 3-ft lengths of strong wire, rope, or\nslightly twisted, foot-wide strips of cloth at\nleast as strongas cotton bed sheeting. Square\nknots with back-up overhand knots are best,\nbut three overhand knots-one on top ofthe\nother-will hold.\n(5) If the crib is more than 8 ft long, place an\nadditional pair of vertical brace-poles, with\none in position at the outside center of each\nlong crib-wall. Tie this pair ofvertical brace-\npoles together permanently just above the\nground, but not yet in the middle or near the\ntop ofthe crib. Temporarily tie each of these\ncenter vertical brace-poles to the uppermost\nside-pole of the wall it touches.\n(6) Line the crib with cloth or plastic film,\nmaking sure that several inches of the lining\nhangs over the uppermost poles. So that the\nlining will not be pulled down when the crib\nis being filled with earth, tie the upperedge of","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":196,"content":"the lining to the uppermost wall pole about\nevery 2 ft. First cut a small hole through\nwhich to thread a tie-string or a 2-in.-wide\ntie-strip of cloth. (If plenty of cloth and/or\nplastic isavailable for lining the cribs, secure\nthe lining by simply wrappinga greaterwidth\nof the upper edge of the lining around the\nuppermost crib wall-pole.)\n(7) Permanently tie together the pair of vertical\ncenter brace-poles, using horizontal ties at\ntheir centers and just below the uppermost\nhorizontal wall-poles of the crib. Use the\nstrongest material you have for these\nhorizontal ties across the center of the crib.\n(8) Excavate earth 10 ft or so beyond the outer\nsides of the cribs. To save work, carry it in\nbuckets and dump it inside the cribs. (Two\nchildren can carry a heavy bucket of earth by\nrunning a strong, 4-ft stick through the bail\nor handle of the bucket and tying the bail to\nthe center of the stick before lifting.) Save\nearth closer to the cribs to put on the roof.\n(9) Fill the lined crib with earth from which\nalmost all grass, roots, and the like have been\nremoved. Avoid placing hard lumps of earth\nin contact with the lining. Fill the crib so that\nthe surface of the earth inside it is about 4in.\nabove the upper sides of the uppermost\nhorizontal poles.\n19. Line the narrow spaces between adjacent cribs\nwith cloth or plastic; then fill these spaces with\neartha littleata time, tampingrepeatedlyso as to\navoid leaving air spaces.\n20. Place the 9-ft roof poles over the main room. (If\npoles are unavailable and boards 11/2 in. thick are\navailable, use two thicknesses of boards.) Usethe\nstrongest roof poles (or double-thickness boards\nnailed together) nearest the entryways. Then put\nshorter, 5- or 6-ft poles or boards over the\nentryways.\n21. To keep earth from falling through the cracks\nbetween the roof poles, put sticks in the larger\ncracks and coverthe roofwith two or more thick-\nnesses of cloth, plastic, or other material. News-\npapers will do, if better materials are lacking.\n22. Put earth on the roof to the depths shownfor the\nillustrated \u0022buried roof.\u0022 Besure to slope all sides\nand smooth this gently mounded earth surfaceso\nthat the buried roof will shed water.\n23. So thatthe earth cover near the outeredges of the\nroof will be a full 2 ft thick, make the earth cover\nslope steeply near the edges. Steep earth slopes\ncan be made and kept stable by using large lumps\nof turf to make a steep bank, or by using earth-\nfilled \u0022rolls\u0022 of cloth or other material along the\nedges of a roof.\n24. Put in place the waterproof material of the\nburied roof.\n25. Pile on the rest of the earth cover, as illustrated,\nto at least a full 2-ft thickness.\n26. Smooth the surface ofthe earth cover, including\nthe sides, so that rain will run off. Do not walk on\nthe finished roof.\n27. To prevent rainwater on the ground outside from\nrunning into the entryways, make mounds of\npacked earth about4 in. high acrossthe entryway\nfloors. Make the mounds about 2 ft from the\nouter ends of the floors. Dig a shallow drainage\nditch completely around the shelter.\n28. Unless the weather is cold, install your shelter-\nventilating KAP in the entry into which you can\nfeel air moving naturally. (If short of time or\nmaterials, make a small Directional Fan.)\n29. To prevent fallout or rain from falling onto the\nfloor of the outerentryways, place smallawnings\n(not illustrated) over the openings.\n30. If time and energy are available, mound earth all\naround the shelter. Doing so will reduce fire\nhazards by covering flammable materials; it also\nwill increase fallout protection.\n31. Fill all available water containers, including pits\nwhich have been dug and lined with plastic, then\nroofed with available materials. If possible,\ndisinfect all waterstored inexpedient containers,\nusing one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,\nsuch as Clorox, for each 10 gallons of water.\nEven if only muddy water is available, store it. If\nyou do not have a disinfectant, it may be possible\nto boil water when needed.\n32. Put all ofyour emergency tools inside your\nshelter.\n33. Astime and materials permit, continue to improve\nyour chances of surviving by doing as many of the\nfollowing things as possible:\n(I) Make a homemade fallout meter, asdescribed\nin Appendix C, and expedient lights.\n(Prudent people will have made these\nextremely useful items well ahead of\ntime.)\n(2) Makeand hangexpedient bedsheet-hammocks.\n(3) Install screens or mosquito netting over the\ntwo openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a\nproblem. Remember, however, that screen or\nnetting reduces the air flow through a shelter\n- even when the air ispumped through with a\nKAP.\n(4) Dig a stand-up hole near the far end of the\nshelter. Make the hole about 15in.indiameter\nand deep enough to permit the tallest of the\nshelter occupants to stand erect occasionally.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":197,"content":"ORNL-DWG 74-8130R\nr\n~\n5?\nVE:.RTIC.AL ~~\neA!\\CL\u00B7POl..~_\nM.l\u0027llM ........DIAMeTER\n2\u00B7Vl,,..\nr\nlZ.V2: H F\u0027DI\\ A S~ \u0022[ RSON 5H[lTe:R l\n- :51\u00271 \u002Bl~tt3~f -Ift PluS HIl~\u002B_CIAEACH PERSON -..4--:$-M\nMlNlMlM .5MALL. t.\u0022D 7~t \u0027S ~~tl\u0027.l~~ICAL\n~~\u0027\u0022Jo If ~ I bf\n1/1./!3 ar- .:: CR B 112ft rPOLe.

THE NEED FOR SHELTER AIR PUMPS\nIn warm weather, large volumes of outside air\nMUST be pumped through. most fallout or blast\nshelters ifthey are crowded and occupied for aday or\nmore. Otherwise, the shelter occupants\u0027 body heat\nand water vapor will raise the temperature-humidity\nconditions to DANGEROUSLY high levels. If\nadequate volumes of outdoor air are pumped\nthrough typical belowground shelters in hot weather,\nmany times the number of persons could survive the\nheat than otherwise could survive in these same\nshelters without adequate forced ventilation. Even-in\ncold weather, about 3 cubic feet per minute(3cfm) of\noutdoor air usually should be pumped through\nshelters, primarily to keep the carbon dioxide\nexhaled by shelter occupants from rising to harmful\nconcentrations.\nThe KAP (Kearny Air Pump) isa practical, do-\nit-yourself device for pumping adequate volumes of\ncooling air through shelters-i-with minimum work.\nThe following instructions have been improved\nrepeatedly after being used by dozens ofsmall groups\nto build KAPs-inciuding families, pairs of house-\nwives, and children. None of these inexpert builders\nhad previously heard of this kind of pump, yetalmost\nall groups succeeded in making one in less than 4\nhours after assembling the materials. Their successes\nprove that almost anyone,ifgiven these detailed and\nthoroughly tested instructions, can build a ser-\nviceable, large-volume air pump of this simple type,\nusing only materials and tools found in most\nAmerican homes.\nIf possible, build a KAP large enough to pump\nthrough your shelter at least 40 cubic feet per minute\n(40 cfm) of outdoor air for each shelter occupant. If\n40 cfm of outdoor air is pumped through a shelter\nand distributed within it as specified below, even\nunder heat-wave conditionsthe effective temperature\nof the shelter air will not be more than 2\u00B0F higher\nthan the effective temperature outdoors. (The\neffective temperature is a measure of air\u0027s effects on\npeopledue to its heat, humidity, and velocity.) The\n36-inch-high by 29-inch-wide KAP described in these\ninstructions, if used as specified, will pump at least\n1000 cfm of outside air through a shelter that has the\nairflow characteristics outlined in these instructions.\nIf more than 25 persons might be expected to\noccupy a shelter during hot weather, then it is\nadvisable to build a larger KAP. The 72-inch-high by\n29-inch-wide model described can pump between\n4000 and 5000 cfm.\nTo maintain tolerable temperature-humidity\n. conditions for people in your shelter during hot\nweather, you must:\n\u2022 Pump enough outdoor air all the way through\nthe shelter (40 cfm for each occupant in very hot,\nhumid weather).\n\u2022 Distribute the air evenly within the shelter. Ifthe\nKAP that pumps air through the shelter does not\ncreate air movement that can be felt inall parts of the\nshelter in hot weather, one or more additional KAPs\nwill be needed to circulate the air and gently fan the\noccupants.\n\u2022 Encourage the shelter occupants to wear as little\nclothing as practical when they are hot. (Sweat\nevaporates and cools best on bare skin.)","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":200,"content":"\u2022 Supply the occupants with adequate water and\nsalt. For prolonged shelter occupancy under heat-\nwave conditions in a hot part of the country, about 4\nquarts of drinking water and 113 ounce(1tablespoon)\nof salt per person are required every 24 hours,\nincluding salt in food that iseaten. Normal American\nmeals supply about 1/4ounce of salt daily. Salt taken\nin addition to that in food should be dissolved in the\ndrinking water.\n\u2022 Pump outdoor air through your shelter day and\nnight in warm weather, so that both the occupants\nand the shelter are cooled off at night.\nAlmost all of the danger from fallout iscaused by\nradiation from visible fallout particles of heavy, sand-\nlike or flakey material. The air does not become\nradioactive due to the radiation continuously given off\nby fallout particles.\nThe visible fallout particles rapidly \u0022fall out\u0022 of\nslow moving air. The air that a KAP pumps through\na shelter moves at a low speed and could carry into\nthe shelter only a very small fraction of the fallout\nparticles thatcause the radiation hazard outside. This\nfraction, usually not dangerous, can be further\nreduced if occupants take the simple precautions\ndescribed in these instructions.\nCAUTION\nBefore anyone starts to build this unusual type\nof air pump, ALL WORKERS SHOULD READ\nTHESE INSTRUCTIONS AT LEAST UP TO\nSECTION V, INSTALLATION. Otherwise, mis-\ntakes may be made and work may be divided\ninefficiently.\nWhen getting ready to build this pump, all\nworkers should spend the first half-hour studying\nthese instructions and getting organized. Then, after\nmaterials are assembled, two inexperienced persons\nworking together should be able to complete the 3-\nfoot model described in the following pages in less\nthan 4 hours. To speed up completion, divide the\nwork; for example, one person can start making the\nflaps while another begins work on the pump frame.\nII. HOW A KAP WORKS\nAs can be seen in Figs. 1and 2, a KAP operates\nby being swung like a pendulum. It is hinged at the\ntop of its swinging frame. When this air pump is\npulled by a cord as illustrated, its flaps are closed by\nair pressure and it pushesair in front of it and \u0022sucks\u0022\nORNL-DWG 66-12320A\n~\u0022\u0027\u0022 _\u0022\u0022oo\u003C,,~,\u0022\u0022\u0027\u0027\u0027\u0027)\n. /\nPULL CORD\n(SLACK)\nFig. 1.

This is the power stroke.\nDuring its power stroke, the pump\u0027s flaps are closed\nagainst its flap-stop wires or strings, which are\nfastened across the face of the frame.\nWhen a KAP swings freely back as a pendulum\non its return stroke, all its flaps are opened by air","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":201,"content":"pressure. The pumped air stream continues to flow in\nthe direction in which it has been accelerated by the\npower stroke, while the Dump itself swings in the\nopposite direction (see Fig. 2). Thus the flaps are\none-way valves that operateto force air to flow in one\ndirection, where desired.\nThe KAP can be used: (I) to supply outdoor air\nto a shelter, (2) to distribute air within a shelter,\nand/ or to fan the occupants.\n1. To force outdoorairthrougha shelter,an air-\nsupply KAP usually is operated as an air-intake\npump by pulling it with a cord (see Fig. I). (Only\nrarely is it necessary to operate a KAP as an air-\nexhaust pump bypushing it with a pole, as described\nin the last section of these instructions.)\n2. To distribute air within a shelter and/or to\nfan the occupants, air-distribution KAPs may be\nhung overhead and operated as described later.\nIII. INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING A KAP\nIn this section, instructions are given for making\na KAP 36 inches high and 29 inches wide, to operate\nefficiently when swinging in a typical home basement\ndoorway 30 inches wide. If your doorway or other\nventilation opening is narrower or wider than 30\ninches, you should make your KAP I inch narrower\nthan the narrowest opening in which you plan to\ninstall it. Regardless of the size of the KAP you plan\nto build, first study the instructions for making the\n36 X 29-inch model.\nIn Section VII you willfind briefinstructions for\nmaking a narrower and even simpler KAP, one more\nsuitable for the narrow openings of small trench\nshelters and other small expedient shelters. Section\nVIII covers large KAPs, for large shelters.\nA. Materials Needed for a KAP\n36 inches High by 29 inches Wide\nThe preferred material is listed as first (1st)\nchoice, and the less-preferred materials are listed as\n(2nd), (3rd), and (4th) choices. It is best to assemble,\nspread out, and check all your materials before\nbeginning to build.\nI. The pump frame and its fixed support:\n\u2022 Boards for the frame:\n(Ist) 22 ft of I X 2-in. boards. (A nominal\nX 2-in. board actually measures about\n3/4 X 1_3/4 in., but the usual, nominal dimen-\nsions will be given throughout these instruc-\ntions.) Also, 6ft of IX I-in. boards.

(Do not use\na tape that stretches: it may shrink afterward and\ncause the flaps to wrinkle.)\n3. The flap pivot-wires:\n(1st) 30 ft of smooth wire at least as heavy and\nspringy as coat hanger wire, that can be made into\nvery straight pieces each 29 in. long (nine all-wire\ncoat hangers will supply enough); (2nd) 35 ft of\nsomewhat thinner wire, including light, flexible\ninsulated wire; (3rd) 35ft ofsmoothstring, preferably\nnylon string about the diameter of coat hanger wire.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":202,"content":"ORNL DWG 71-7003\nIX2-in.

Ifyou have smooth,\nstraight wire as springy and thick as coat hangerwire,\nuse it to make nine 29-in.-long straight lengths of\nwire. Ifnot. use wire from all-wire coat hangers or use\nstrings. First, cut off all of the hook portion of each\ncoat hanger, including the twisted part. If you have\nonly ordinary pliers, use the cutter to \u0022bite\u0022 the wire\nall around; it will break at this point if bent there.\n\u0027\u003Eext. straighten each wire carefully. Straighten all\nthe bends so that each wire isstraight within \u0027/4 in., as\ncompared to a straight line. Proper straightening\ntakes I to S minutes per wire. To straighten,\nrepeatedly grasp the bent part of the wire with pliers\nin slightly different spots, each time bending the wire\na little with vour other hand. Then cut each wire to a\n29-in. length. Finally, bend no more than 1/2 in. of\neach end at a right angle and in the same plane-that\nis. in directions so that all parts of the bent wire will\nlieflat against a smooth surface.

Or make the hem\nby sewing it very close to the cut edge to form a\nhem-tunnel\u0022 (see Fig. 5).\nAfter the hem has been made, cut a notch with\nscissors in each hemmed corner of the flap (Figs. 6\nand 8). Avoid cutting the tape holding the hem.\nEach notch should extend downward about 1/2 in.\nand should extend.horizontally from the outer edge\nof the flap to 1/4 in. inside the inner side of the\nframe, when the flap is positioned on the frames as\nshown in Fig. 6.\nQRNL-DWG 66-12324\nBRACE\nFig. 6.

For example, a\n36 X 29-in. KAP should have a passageway no\nsmaller than about 3112 sq. ft. An air-supply KAP of\nthis size will force at least 1000 cubic feet per\nminute (1000 cfm) through a shelter having such\nopenings, if it is installed\u0022as illustrated in Fig. 14.\nIf smaller air passageways or air-exhaust\nopenings are provided, the volume of air pumped\nwill be greatly reduced. For example, if the\nair-exhaust opening is only 13/4 sq. ft e/4 the size of\nthis KAP), then this KAP will pump only about\n500 cfm. A!1d if the air-exhaust opening is only a\n6 X 6-in. exhaust duct e/4 sq. ft), then this same\n36 X 29-in. KAP will pump only about 50 cubic\nfeet per minute. This would not provide enough\noutdoor air for more than one shelter occupant in a\nwell-insulated shelter under heat-wave conditions in\nthe hottest humid. parts of the United States. In\ncontrast, when the weather is freezing cold and the\u0022\nshelter itself is still cold enough to absorb the heat\nproduced by the shelter occupants, this same\n6 X 6-in. exhaust duct and the air-intake doorway\nwill cause about 50 cfm of outdoor air to flow by\nitself through the shelter without using any pump.\nThe reason: body heat warms the shelter air, and\nthe warm air rises if cold air can flow in to replace\nit. Under these cold conditions-provided the air is\ndistributed evenly throughout the shelter by KAP\nor otherwise-50 cfm IS enough outdoor arr for\nabout 17 people.\nTo provide adequately large air passageways\nfor air-supply KAPs used to ventilate shelters in\nbuildings, in addition to opening and closing doors\nand windows, it may be necessary to build large\nducts (as described below). Breaking holes in\nwindows, ceilings, or walls is another way to make\nlarge, efficient air passageways.\nFigure 15 illustrates how a 3-ft KAP can be\nused as a combined air-supply and air-distribution\npump to adequately ventilate a small underground\nshelter that has an exhaust opening too small to\nprovide enough ventilation in warm weather.

Adequate Distribution of\nAir Within the Shelter\nTo make sure that each shelter occupant gets a\nfair share of the outdoor air pumped through the\nshelter, air-distribution KAPs should be used inside\nmost large shelters. These KAPs are used within the\nshelter, separate from and in addition to air-supply\nKAPs (see Fig. 16).Air-distribution KAPs can serve\nin place of both air-distribution ducts and cooling\nfans. For these purposes, one or more 3-ft-high KAPs\nhung overhead from the shelter ceiling are usually\nmost practical. IfKAPs cannot readily be hung from\nthe ceiling, they can be supported on light frames\nmade of boards or metal, somewhat like those used\nfor a small child\u0027s swing.\nKAP for every 25 occupants. In relatively wide\nshelters, these interior KAPs should be positioned so\nthat they produce an airflow that circulates around\nthe shelter, preventing the air that is being pumped\ninto the shelter from flowing directly to the exhaust\nopening. Figure 16illustrates how four KAPs can be\nused in this way to distribute the air within a shelter\nand to fan the 100occupants of a 1000-sq.-ft shelter\nroom.

OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE\nA. Pumping\nOperate your 3-foot KAP by pulling it with an\neasy, swinging motion of your arm. To pump the\nmaximum volume of air, you should pull the KAP\ntoward you until its frame swings out to an almost-\nhorizontal position. Then quickly move your hand so\nthat the pull-cord is kept slackduringtheentire, free-\nswinging return stroke. Figure 24 in Section VIII,\nLARGE KAPs, illustrates this necessary motion.\nBe sure to provide a comfortable hand-hold on\nthe pull-cord (see Fig. 14). Blisters can be serious\nunder unsanitary conditions.\nTo pull a KAP via an overhead pulley with\nminimum effort, sit down and pull as If you were\ntollinga bell---except that you should raise yourhand\nquickly with the return stroke and keep it raised long\nenough so that the pull-cord remains slackduringthe\nentire return stroke. Or, if the pulley is not overhead,\noperate the KAP by swinging your extended arm\nback and forth from the shoulder;\nB. Placement to Take Advantage of the\nNatural Direction of Air Flow\nA KAP can pump more air into a shelter if it is\ninstalled so that it pumps air through the shelter in\nthe direction in which the air naturally flows. Since\nthis direction can be reversed by a wind change\noutdoors. it isdesirable to provide a way to quickly\nremove your pumpand reposition it so that air can be\npumped in the opposite direction. This can bedone in\nseveral ways. including making one set of quick-\nremoval brackets for one air openingand a second set\nfor the other.\nC. Maintenance\nTo operate your KAP efficiently, keep the flaps\nin good repair and make sure that there is the\nminimum practicalarea of openspaces inand around\nthe KAP through which air can flow back around the\npump frame, opposite to the pumped direction. So\nkeep at least some extra flap material in yourshelter,\nalong with some extratape and the fewtoolsyou may\nneed to make repairs.\nVII. NARROW KAPs AND SMALL KAPs\nA. Narrow KAPs\nTo swing efficiently in an entrance or emergency\nexit of an expedient trench shelter that is22 in. wide,\na KAP isbest made 20in. wide and 36in. high. One of\nless height is not as efficient as a 36-in.-high model\nand has to be pulled uncomfortably fast. So, when\nventilation openings can be selected or made at least\n38 in. high, make your pump 36 in. high.\nIn a narrow trench shelter, it is best to have the\npull-cord run the full length of the trench, along the\ntrench wall that occupants will face when sitting.\nThen each occupant can take a turn pullingthe pump\nwithout having to change seats.\nGood metal hinges on a narrow KAP allow it to\nswing properly if pulled with the pull-cord attached\nto one side of the frame. (Pumps with improvised\nhinges and large pumps must be pulled from a\nconnection point on their center vertical brace to\nmake them swing properly.) Therefore, if you have\nsmall metal hinges and need a KAP no wider than 20\ninches, build a rectangular frame without a vertical\ncenter brace. Make two pull-cord attachment points,\none on each side of the frame and each 9inches below\nthe top of the frame. (Fora small KAP, a satisfactory\nattachment point can readily be made by drivingtwo\nnails so that their heads cross, and wiring them\ntogether.) Then if a change in wind direction outside\ncauses the direction of natural air flow in the trench\nto become opposite to the direction in which air is\nbeing pumped, you can move your KAP to the\nopening at the other end of the trench. The pull-cord\ncan easily be connected to the otherside of the frame,\nand convenient pumping can be resumed quickly.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":212,"content":"So that the horizontal support board can be\nnailed easily to the roofing poles or boards ofan entry\ntrench, it is best to use cabinet hinges.

SOLUTIONS TO SPECIAL PROBLEMS\nA. Increasing the Usefulness of Shelters\nby Supplying 40 cfm per Planned Occupant\nIf a shelter is fully occupied for days during hot\nweather and iscooled bothday and night bypumping\nthrough it and distributing at least 40 cubic feet per\nminute of outdoorair for each occupant-more than\nis required to maintain tolerable temperatures at\nnight-these advantages result: .\n\u2022 The shelter occupants will be exposed to\neffective temperatures less than 2\u00B0F higher than the\ncurrent effective temperatures outdoors, and at night\nwill get relief from extreme heat.\n\u2022 The floors, walls, etc. of a shelter so ventilated\nwill be cooled at night to temperatures well below\ndaytime temperatures. Therefore, during the day a\nconsiderable fraction ofthe occupants\u0027body heatwill\nflow into the floors, walls, and other parts of the\nshelter and less body heat will have to be carried out\nby the exhaust airduringthe hottest hours oftheday.\nThus daytime temperatures will be reduced.\n\u2022 Since the shelter occupants will be cooler and\nwill sweat less, especially at night, they will need less\nwater than they would require if the shelter were\nventilated at a rate of less than 40 cfm per occupant.\n(If the outdoor air is very hot and desert-dry, it\nusually is better to supply less than 40 cfm per\noccupant during the hottest hours of the day.)\n\u2022 Ifthe shelter were to be endangered by the entry\nof outside smoke, carbon monoxide or other\npoisonous gases, or heavy descending fallout under\nwindy conditions, ventilation of the shelter could be\ntemporarily restricted or stopped for a longer period\nthan would be practical if the shelter itself were\nwarmer at the beginning of such a crisis period.\nI.

Pre-Cooling Shelters\nIf the shelter itself is cooler than the occupants,\nmore of the body heat of occupants can flow into its\ncool walls, ceiling, and floor. Therefore, it would be\nadvantageous to pre-cool a shelter that may soon be\noccupied, especially during hot weather. KAPs (or\nother air pumps or fans) can be used to pre-cool a\nshelter by forcing .the maximum volume of cooling\noutdoor air through the shelter and by distributing it\nwithin the shelter. A shelter should be pre-cooled at\nall times when the air temperature outdoors is lower\nthan the air temperature inside the shelter. Then, if\nthe pre-cooled shelter is used, the occupants will be\nkept cooler at a given rate of ventilation than if the\nshelter had not been pre-cooled, because the air will\nnot have to carryall of their body heat out of the\nshelter.\nC. Increasing the Effectiveness of a KAP\nIfyou want to increase the volume of air that a\nKAP with good metal hinges can force through a\nshelter, Install side baffles (see Fig. 25). Side baffles\nshould be rigidly fixed to form two stationary\n\u0022walls,\u0022 one on each side of the swinging pump\nframe. They can be made of plywood, boards, doors,\ntable tops, or even well-braced plastic. A space or\nclearance of 112 to I in. should bemaintained between\nthe inner side of each baffle and the outer side of the\nswinging frame.\nBy installing side baffles you may be able to\nincrease the volume of air your KAP will pump byas\nmuch as 20%, if it is ingood repair and the openings\naround it are small.\nORNL-DWG GG-12.,,41\u0027.\nALL UNUSED OPENINGS IN\nDOORWAY SHOULD BE COVERED\nLENGTH OF KEARNY PUMP \u002B2 in\nFig. 25. Side baffles.\nD. Operating a KAP as an Exhaust Pump\nIn some shelters, a KAP can be operated most\neffectively by using it as an exhaust pump. This can\nbe done by pushing it with a push-poleattached to its\ncenter vertical brace. Push-pole operation is some-\ntimes the best way to \u0022suck\u0022outdoorair into a shelter\nby pumping air out of the shelter in the natural\ndirection of air flow; for example, up an elevator\nshaft or up a stairwell. This method is especially\nuseful in those basement shelters in which air-intake\nopenings are impractical for installing KAPs. This\nwould be the case ifthe air-intake openingsare small,\nexposed windows or holes broken in the ceiling of a\nshelter in a building.\nTo pump a large KAP most effectively with a\npush-pole, stand with your back to the KAP and\ngrasp the push-pole with both hands. Using mostly\nyour leg muscles, push the KAP by pulling the free\nend of its push-pole toward you.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":216,"content":"Figure 26shows an improvised, flexible connec-\ntion of a push-pole attached to the center brace of a\nlarge KAP 28 in. from the top of its frame.\nORNL-OWG 66-\u00272332R\nFLAP\nSlOPS\nCORD WITH ADJUSTABLE SLIPKNOT\nTO HOLD LEATHER TIGHTLY TO END\nOF PUSH-POLE\nPIECE OF LEATHER (FROM\nSHOE UPPER OR WIDE BELT)\nSHOWN AFTER\nTIGHTENING\nONLY THIS KNOT\n9 FOOT LONG WOODEN POLE. 3/~ x 11/4 in.\n(WITH UPPER AND LOWER EDGES OF tTS\nEND RQUNDEOl,l$ BEST FOR A 3-FOOT\nMODEL.

Ventilating a Shelter with\nOnly One Opening\nSome basement rooms that may be used as\nshelters have only one opening, the doorway. A KAP\ncan be used to ventilate sucha shelter room ifenough\nwell-mixed and distributed air is movingjust outside\nthe doorway, or if air from outdoors can be pumped\nin by another KAP and made to flow in a hallway or\nroom and pass just outside this doorway. Figure 27\nindicates how to ventilate such a one-opening room\nby operating a 3-ft KAP as an air-intake pump inthe\nupper part of the doorway.\nBelow such a doorway KAP, a \u0022divider\u0022 6 ft to\n8 ft long can be installed. The divider permitsexhaust\nair to flow out of the room without much of it being\n\u0022sucked\u0022 back into the room by the KAP swinging\nabove it. Plywood, reinforced heavy cardboard, or\neven well-braced plastic can be used to make a\ndivider. It should be installed so that, in a possible\nemergency, it can be jerked out of the way in a few\nseconds.\nWhen used with a divider, a 36X29in. KAP can\npump almost 1000 cubic feet\u0027 of air per minute into\nand out of such a shelter room. Although 1000cubic\nfeet of well-distributed air is sufficient for several\ntimes as many as 25 shelter occupants under most\ntemperate climate conditions, it is enough for only\nabout 25 people in a one-entry room under\nexceptionally severe heat-wave conditions. Further-\nmore, to make it habitable for even 25 people under\nsuch conditions, the air in this room must be kept\nfrom rising more than 2\u00B0F above the temperature\noutdoors. This can be done using a second air-supply\nKAP to pump enough outdoor air through the\nbuilding and in some cases also using air-distribution\nKAPs in spaces outside the one-entry room. The\nKAP in the doorway of a one-entry room should\nsupply 40 cfm per occupant of this room.\nIn order to prevent any of the used, warmed,\nexhaust air from the one-entry room from being\n\u0022sucked\u0022by the doorway KAP back into the room, a\nstiffened rectangular duct can be builtsoas to extend\nthe exhaust-opening (in the lower part of the\ndoorway) several feet outside the room. Such a duct\ncan be built of plastic supported by a frame of small\nboards. It can be used to discharge the exhaustair far\nenough away from the KAP and \u0022downstream\u0022inthe\nairflow outside the one-opening room so that no\nexhausted air can be \u0022sucked\u0022 back into the room.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":217,"content":"ORNL DWG 72-8203\n///\n/\n\\PULL-CORD PULLING\n\\\n~ \\. \u0022\u0027~ ~ /,/-----\n.Ie--...-- r\u0022 \u0027\u0022~ r\u0022: Jt\u0022-./------\n~ ~ K J? /\nf 8-ft \u0022DIVIDER\u0022 IN DOORWAY\nFig. 27.

Building More Durable KAPs\nIf you are building KAPs in normal times, you\nmay want to use materialsthat will makeyourpumps\nlast longer, even though these materials are more\n.difficult to obtain and are more expensive.\nDurability tests have shown that the KAP parts\nthat wear out first are the flaps and the pulleys. In6-ft\nKAPs, the lower flaps are subject to hard use. Lower\nflaps made of 6-oz (per sq.. yd), clear, nylon-\nreinforced, plied vinyl have lasted undamaged for\nover 1000 hours of full-stroke pumping, without\nhaving their edges reinforced. Lowerflaps made of6-\nmil nylon-reinforced polyethylene, without edge\nreinforcements, have lasted for 1000hours with only\nminor damage.\nTo prevent a filter used with a KAP from\ncausing too greata reduction in the volume ofair that\nthe KAP can pump through your shelter, you must\nuse large areas of low-resistance filter material. An\nexample: In one ventilation test, a large basement\nshelter was used which had two ordinarydoorways at\nits oppositeends. These served as itsair-intakeand its\nair-exhaust openings. A 72X 29in. KAP operating in\none doorway pumped almost 5000 cubic feet per\nminute through the shelter. But when a filter frame\nholding 26 square feet of l-in-thick fiberglass dust\nfilters was placed across the air-intake stairwell, the\nKAP could pump only about 3400 cfm through this\nfilter and the shelter.\nThe best pulley tested was a marine pulley such\nas that used on small sailboats, with a Delrin\n(DuPont) 2-in.-diameter wheel and J/win. stainless\nsteel shaft. This pulley was undamaged after\noperating a 6-ft KAP for 324 hours.

The Need for Accurate and Dependable Fallout Meters\nIfa nuclear war ever strikes the United States, survivors of the blast and fire effects\nwould needto havereliablemeans of knowing whenthe radiation intheenvironment\naround their shelters had dropped enough to let them venture safely outside. Civil\ndefense teams could use broadcasts of surviving radio stations to give listeners a\ngeneral idea of the fallout radiation in some broadcast areas. However, the fallout\nradiation can vary widelyfrom point to point and the measurements are likelyto be\nmade too far from most shelters to make them accurate enough to use safely.\nTherefore, each shelter should have some dependable method of measuring the\nchanging radiation dangers in its own area.\nDuring a possible rapidly worsening nuclear crisis, or after a nuclear attack, most\nunprepared Americans could not buy or otherwise obtain a fallout meter -- an\ninstrument that would greatly improve their chances ofsurvivinga nuclear war. The\nfact that the dangers from fallout radiation- bestexpressed interms ofthe radiation\ndose rate, roentgens per hour (RI hr) -- quite rapidly decrease during the first few\ndays, and then decrease more and more slowly, makes it very important to have a\nfallout metercapable ofaccurately measuring the unseen, unfeltand changing fallout\ndangers. Occupants ofafallout shelter should beable to minimizethe radiationdoses\nthey receive. In order to effectively minimize the radiation doses, a dependable\nmeasuring instrument isneeded to determine the doses they receivewhilethey are in\nthe shelter and while they are outside for emergency tasks, such as going out to get\nbadly needed water. Also, such an instrument would permit them to determine when\nit is safe to leavethe shelter for good.\nUntrainedfamilies,guided only bythese written instructionsand using onlylowcost\nmaterials and tools found inmost homes, have beenable to make a KFM byworking\n3 or 4 hours. Bystudying the operating sections of these instructions for about IV2\nhours, average untrained familieshave beenable to successfullyusethisfallout meter\nto measure dose rates and to calculate radiation doses received, permissible times of\nexposure, etc.\nThe KFM (Kearny Fallout Meter) was developed at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory. It is understandable, easily repairable, and as accurate as most civil\ndefense fallout meters. In the United States in 1986 the least expensive\ncommercially available dose-rate meter that is accurate and dependable\nand that measures high enough dose rates for wartime use is a British\ninstrumentthatretailsfor $375. ComparableAmericaninstruments retail\nfor over $1000.\nBeforea nuclear attack occurs is the best time to build, test and learn how to use a\nKFM. However, this instrument isso simple that itcould be made evenafter fallout\narrives provided that all the materials and tools needed (seelistsgivenin Sections V,\nVI, and VII) and a copy of these instructions have been carried into the shelter.\nII. Survival WorkPriorities During a Crisis\nBefore building a KFM, persons expecting a nuclear attack within a few hO,urs or\ndays and already inthe placewhere they intend to await attack should work with the\nfollowing priorities: (I) build or improve a high-protection-factorshelter (ifpossible,\nashelter covered with 2or 3feetofearthand separatefrom flammable buildings). At\nthe same time, make and install a KAP (a homemade shelter-ventilating pump) - if\ninstructions and materials are available. If not available, at least make a\nDirectionalFan. Alsostore at least 15gallons ofwater for each shelter occupant-\nifcontainersare available. (2)Assembleall materials for one or two KFM s.(3)Make\nand store the drying agent (byheating wallboard gypsum, as later described)for both\nthe KFM and its dry-bucket. (4) Complete at least one KFM.\nIII.Howto UseThese instructions to Best Advantage\nI. Read ALOUD all of these instructions through Section VB, \u0022Tools Needed,\u0022\nbefore doing anything else.\n2. Next assemble all of the needed materials and tools.\n3.

ITSACCURACY ISAUTOMATICALLY AND PERMANENTLY ESTAB-\nLISHED BY UNCHANGING LAWS OF NATURE. Unlike factory made radiation\nmeasuring instruments, A KFM NEVER NEEDS TO BECALIBRATED OR TESTED\nWITH A RADIATION SOURCE. A KFM isused witha watch and the following table\nthat is based on numerous calibrations made at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.\nAs will be fully explained later. the radiation dose rate is determined\nby:\nThe millimeter scale is cut out and attached (see photo illustrations on the following\npage) to the clear plastic cover of the KFM so that its zero mark is directly above the\ntwo leaves in their discharged position when the KFM is resting on a horizontal\nsurface. A reading of the separation of the leaves is taken by noting the number of\nmillimeters that the lower edge ofone leafappears to be on. on one side of the zero\nmark on the scale. and almost at the same time noting the number of millimeters\nthe lower edge of the other leafappears to be on. on the other side of the zero mark.\nThe sum of these two apparent positions of the lower edges of the two leaves is\ncalled a KFM reading. The drawing appearing after the photo illustrations shows\nthe loweredges of the leaves of a KFM appearing to be 9 mm on the right of zero and\n10on the left, giving a KFM reading of 19mm.

To use a KFM, an electrostatic charge\nmust first be placed on its two separate aluminum-foil\nleaves. These leaves are insulated by being suspended\nseparately on clean, dry insulating threads.\nTo take accurate readings. the air inside a KFM must\nbe kept very dry by means of drying agents such as\ndehydrated gypsum (easily made by heating gypsum\nwallboard. \u0022sheetrock\u0022) or silica gel. (Do not use\ncalcium chloride or other saIt.) Pieces of drying agent\nare placed on the bottom of the ionization chamber\n(the housing can) of a KFM.\nWhen the two KFM leavesare charged electrostatically, their likecharges (both positive\nor both negative) cause them to be forced apart. When fallout gamma radiation (that is\nsimilar to X rays but more energetic) strikes the air inside the ionization chamber of a\nKFM. itproduces charged ions inthisenclosed air. Thesecharged ionscause part or allof\nthe electrostatic charge on the aluminum-foil leavesto bedischarged. Asa result of losing\ncharge. the two KFM leaves move closer together.\nA KFM-maker who wants visual proof that his instrument can be partially or wholly\ndischarged by ionizing radiation should persuade his dentist to place the charged KFM\nabout 20 inches directly below a typical dental X-ray\nmachine. For example, when a typical 90 kvp machine was\nset at 15 milliamps and for a 1/20th second pulse. its\ncolumnated X-ray beam partially discharged the KFM\u0027s\nseparated aluminum-foil leaves. promptly reducing the\ninitial reading of 15mm to 9 mm.

Standard aluminum foil - 2 square feet. (In 1987.2 square feet of widely sold U.S.\nbrands of aluminum foil weighed between 8.0 and 8.5 grams. One gram equals 0.035\nounce.) (If only \u0022Heavy Duty\u0022 or \u0022Extra Heavy Duty\u0022 aluminum foil isavailable. make 5-ply\nleaves rather than S-ply leaves of standard foil: the resultant fallout meter will be almost as\naccurate.)\n3. Doorbell-wire. or other light insulated wire (preferably but not necessarily a single-strand wire\ninside the insulation h inches.\n4. Any type of clean, fine thread that has not been anti-static treated will serve to\nsuspend a KFM\u0027s leaves. (Almost all kinds of sewing thread and fly-tying thread\nmanufactured in 1987 are anti-static treated. are poor insulators. and are unsatis-\nIactory.) In 1987 the best widely available excellent insulating thread is unwaxed\ndental floss: floss is not anti-static treated. Most unwaxed dental floss is too thick and\nstiff for properly suspending KFM leaves. but. since dental floss is not a twisted\nthread. Y9u can make flexible strand-threads from it. Make each no more than one-\nquarter as thick as the floss. and about 12 inches long. First separate several strands\nat the end of the floss outside its dispenser. Then separate strands while pulling one\nwayan the end of the strand-thread that you want and the other way on the unwanted\nstrands. Use only a clean needle to touch and separate the strands in the middle 6\ninches of the 12-inch-long piece of unwaxed dental floss.\nA widely sold dental floss. Johnson and Johnson\u0027s Extra Fine Unwaxed. drawn outof\nits dispenser without splitting it. makes quite satisfactory leaf-supporting threads.\nHowever. better leaf-supporting threads can be made by first separating any dental\nfloss into thinner. more flexible threads.\nVery thin monofilament fishing line or leader is an excellent insulator. The 2-pound-\ntest strength. such as Du Pont\u0027s \u0022Stren\u0022 monofilament fishing line. is best. \u0022Trilene\u0022\n2-pound \u0022nylon leader.\u0022 a monofilament manufactured by Berkley and Company.\nalso is excellent. (A 4-pound monofilament line will serve. but is disadvantageously\nstiff.) Some modern monofilament lines or leaders such as \u0022Trilene\u0022 contain an\nadditive that makes them pliant. but also makes them poorer insulators for the first\nseveral hours after being taken out of their dispenser and used to suspend the leaves\nof a KFM. However. in about6 hours the silica gel or anhydrite dryingagent in a KFM\nremoves this additive and the monofilament becomes as good an insulator as even\nstrands of unwaxed dental floss.\nTo minimize thechance of usinga piece of monofilamentorotherthread thathasbeen\nsoiled and thus changed into a poor insulator. always first remove and discard the\noutermost layer of threadon any spool thathas notbeen kept clean in a plastic bagor\nother packaging after being initially unwrapped.\nDuring a worsening crisis or after an attack. neither thread that has not been anti-\nstatic treated. nor unwaxed dental floss. nor clean 2-pound or 4-pound monofilament\nline may be available. However. most American homes have an excellent insulator.\nvery thin polyethylene film - especially clean dry cleaners\u0027 bags. A narrow\ninsulatingstripcutonly 1/16inch wide can be usedto suspendeach KFM leaf. instead\nof an insulatingthread. (Installedleaves suspended on strips of thin plasticfilm must\nbe handled with care.)\nTo cut 1/ 16-inch-widestrips from verythin polyethylenefilm. first cut a pieceabout6\nx 10 inches. Tape only the two 6-inch-wide ends to a piece of paper (such as a brown\ngrocery bag). so that the film is held flat and smooth on the paper. Make 10 marks.\n1/ 16-inchapart. oneach of the two tapes that are holdingthe film. Place a light so that\nits reflection onthe film enables you to see the edge of the film thatyou are preparing\nto cut. Then use a very sharp. clean knife or clean razor blade. guided by the edge of a\nfirmly held ruler. to cut 9 strips. of which you will select the best two. When cutting.\nhold the knife almost horizontal, with the plane of its blade perpendicular to the\ntaped-down film. Throughout this procedure avoid touching the center parts of the\nstrips.\n5. A piece of clear plastic film - a 6 x 6 inch square. Clear vinyl (4 mils thick) used for\nstorm-proofing windows is best. butany reasonably stoutand clear plastic will serve.\nThe strong clear plastic used to wrap pieces of cheese. if washed with hot water and\nsoap. is good.

Make the Drying Agent\n--The Easiest Part to Make, but Time Consuming .-\nFor a KFM to measure radiation accurately, the air inside its ionization\nchamber must be kept very dry. An excellent drying agent (anhydrite) can be\nmade by heating the gypsum in ordinary gypsum wallboard (sheetrock). Do\nNOTuse calcium chloride.\nTake a piece of gypsum wallboard approximately 12 inches by 6 inches, and\npreferablywith its gypsum about 3/8 inches thick. Cut offthe paper and glue,\neasiest done by first wetting the paper. [Since water vapo~ from normal air\npenetrates the plastic cover ofa KFM and can dampen the anhydrite and make\nit ineffective in as shorta time as two days, fresh batches of anhydrite must be\nmade before the attack and kept ready inside the shelter for replacement. The\nuseful life of the drying agent inside a KFM can be greatly lengthened by\nkeeping the KFM inside an .airtight container (such as a peanut butterjar with\na 4-inch-diameter mouth) with some drying agent, when the KFM is not being\nused.]\nBreak the white gypsum filling into small pieces and make the\nlargest no more than 112 in. across. (The tops of pieces larger\nthan this may be too close to the aluminum foil leaves.) If the\ngypsum is dry, using a pair of pliers makes breaking it easier.\nMake the largestside ofthe largest pieces nobiggerthan this.\nDry gypsum is not a drying agent. To drive the water out of the gy~sum\nmolecules and produce the drying agent (anhydrite), heat the gypsum In an\noven at its highest temperature (which should be above 400 degrees F) fo~ one\nhour. Heat the gypsum after placing the small pieces no more than two pieces\ndeep in a pan. Or heat the pieces over a fire for 20 minutes or more in a pan or\ncan heated to a dull red.\na. So that the right amount of anhydrite can be taken quickly out of its\nstoragejar, put enough pieces of gypsum in a can with the same diameter\nas the KFM, measuring out a batch of gypsum that almost covers the\nbottom ofthe can with a single layer.\nb. Cut a piece of aluminum foil about 8 in. x 8 in. square, and fold up its\nedges to form a bowl-like container in which to heat one batch of gypsum\npieces.\nMeasure out 10or 12such batches, and puteach batch in its aluminum foil\n\u0022bowl.\u0022\nc.\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\nS.\nVI. Useful but not Essential Materials\n--Which Could be Obtained Before a Crisis--\nVII. Tools Needed\nAnairtight container (such as a large peanut butter jar) with a mouth at least 4\ninches wide, inwhich to keep a KFM, along with some drying agent, when it is\nnot being used. Keeping a KFM very dry greatly extends the time during\nwhich the drying agent inside the KFM remains effective.\nCommercial anhydrite with a color indicator, such as the drying agent Drierite.\nThis granular form of anhydrite remains light blue as long as it iseffectiveas a\ndryingagent; itturns pink when it becomes ineffective. Oruse silicagel with\ncolor indicator, that is dark blue when effective and that turns light\npink when it becomes ineffective. Heating in a hot oven or in a can\nover a fire reactivates them as drying agents and restores their blue\ncolor. Obtainable from laboratory supply sources. Use enough to\ncover the bottom of the KFM\u0027s can no more than 1/2 inch deep.\nFour square feet of aluminum foil, to make a moisture-proof cover for the\ndry-bucket.\n3.\n2.\n1.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":232,"content":"I\n(\u0027t)\nC)\na..\nI\n(\u0027t)\nC)\na.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":233,"content":"Since anhydrite absorbs water from the air very rapidly, quickly put it in a dry\nairtight container while it is still quite hot.

The pieces should almost cover the\nbottom of the can, with no piece on top of other pieces.\nTo remove anhydrite from a KFM, use a pair of scissors or tweezers as\nforceps, holding them in a vertical position and not touching the leaves.\nIX. Make the Ionization Chamberof the KFM\n(ToAvoidMistakes and Save Time,\nRead AllofThis Section ALOUDBefore Beginning Work.)\nRemove the paper label (ifany) from an ordinary 8-ounce can from which the\ntop has been smoothly cut. Wash the can with soap and water and dry it. (An\n8-ounce can has an inside diameter ofabout 2-9/16inches and an inside height\nofabout2-7/8 inches.)\nSkipto step 3if an 8-ounce can is available. If an 8-ounce can is not available,\nreduce the height of any other can having an inside diameter of about 2-9/16\ninches (such as most soup cans, most pop cans, or most beer cans). To cut off\nthe top part ofa can, first measure and mark the line on which to cut. Then to\nkeep from bending the can while cutting, wrap newspaper tightly around a\nstick or a round wooden tool handle, so that the wood is covered with 20 to 30\nthicknesses of paper and the diameter (ideally) is only slightly less than the\ndiameterofthe can.\nOne person should hold the can over the paper-covered stick while a second\nperson cuts the can little by little along the marked cutting line. If leather\ngloves are available, wear them. Tocut the can off smoothly, use a file, or use\na hacksaw drawn backwards along the cutting line. Or cut the can with a\n.sharp, short blade of a pocketknife by: (1) repeatedly stabbing downward\nvertically through the can into the paper, and (2)repeatedly making a cut about\n1/4 inch long by moving the knife into a sloping position, while keeping its\npoint still pressed into the papercovering the stick.\nNext, smooth the cut edge, and cover it with small pieces of freezer tape or\notherflexible tape.\n3. Cut out the PAPER PATTERN TO WRAP AROUND KFM CAN. (Cut\none pattern out of Pattern Page A.) GIue (ortape) this pattern to the can,\nstarting with one of the two short sides of the pattern. Secure this starting\nshort side directly over the side seam of the can. Wrap the pattern snugly\naround the can, gluing or taping it securely as it is being wrapped. (If the\npattern istoo wide to fit flat between the rims of the can, trim a little off its\nlower edge.)\n4. Sharpen a small nail, by filing,or rubbing on concrete, for use as a punch\nto make the four holes needed to install the stop-threads in the ionization\nchamber (the can).

Cut out a piece of standard aluminum\nfoilapproximately 4 inches by 8 inches.\n2. Fold the aluminum foil to make a 2-ply\n(= 2 thicknesses) sheet approximately 4\ninches by 4 inches.\n3. Fold this 2-ply sheet to make a 4-ply\nsheet approximately 2 inches by 4\ninches.\nBefore threading the thread through the four holes, tie a small toggle (see the\npreceding sketch) to the long end of the thread. (This toggle can easily be made\nof a very small sliver of wood cut about 3/8 in. long.) After the thread has been\npulled through the four holes, attach a second toggle to the thread, about 112inch\nfrom the part of the thread that comes out of the fourth hole. Then the thread can\nbe pulled tightly down the side of the can and the second small toggle can be\ntaped securely in place to the side of the can. (If the thread is taped down without\na toggle, it is likely to move under the tape.)\nThe first toggle and all of the four holes also should be covered with tape, to\nprevent air from leaking into the can after it has been covered and is being used\nas an ionization chamber.\nS. Cut out the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, found on the following Pattern Page\nB. Note that this pattern is NOTa square and that it is smaller than the 8-ply\nsheet. Flatten the 8 thicknesses of aluminum foil with the fingers until they\nappear to be a single thin, flat sheet.\n6. Hold the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN on top of the 8-ply aluminum foil\nsheet, with the pattern\u0027s THIRD-FOLDEDGE on top of the third-fold edge of\nthe 8-ply aluminum sheet. Be sure that one lower comer of the\nFINISHED-LEAF PATTERN is on top of the exacdy square comer of the\n8-ply aluminum sheet.\n.If only heavy duty aluminum foil (sometimes called \u0022extra heavy duty\u0022) is\navailable, make S-plyleaves of the same size, and use the table for the 8-ply KFM\nto determine radiation dose rates. To make a S-ply leaf, start by cutting out a\npiece of foil approximately 4 inches by 4 inches. Fold it to make a 4-ply sheet\napproximately 2 inches by 2 inches, with one corner exactly square. Next from a\nsingle thickness of foil cut a square approximately 2 inches by 2 inches. Slip this\nsquare into a 4-ply sheet, thus making a S-ply sheet. Then make the S-ply leaf,\nusing the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, etc. as described for making an 8-ply leaf.\nNNN","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":238,"content":"Iv\n0\u003Ea,","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":239,"content":"223\nINSTRUCTIONS, Page 11\nPATTERN FOR CLEAR-PLASTIC COVER FOR KFM CAN\nSHORT SIDE\n~liJ\n~ ~1- 1 ::::,.\nPOSITION TO ATTACH ~l:o=(\nTHE PAPER SCALE TO liJ \u0027:j\nTHE COVER OF CAN, ~ ~\nPERPENDICULAR TO cc 1-_\nTHE KFM LEAVES ~ IliJ \u003C, \u0022-\n/ \u003C: ~ \u0022-\n/ liJ 1-~~\u0027-\u003E v\n/ ~\\\n0\\\nI ~\\I ~\n\\ ~J\n\\ .

Take an\ninitial reading. If after 3 hours its reading has decreased by 1mm, or\nless. this means that its leaf-suspending threads are good insulators\nand that your KFM can reliably measure dose rates as low as 0.03\nroentgens per hour (30 milliroentgens per hour). By post-attack\nstandards, 30 mRlhr is a low dose rate. In a whole month of\ncontinuous exposure (an impossibility, because fallout decays), 30\nmRlhr would result in a dose of 21.9 roentgens - not enough to\nincapacitate. Warning: In.heavy fallout areas, for the first few days\nafter fallout deposition the dose rates inside even most good shelters\nwill be higher than 0.03 R/hr.\nTrouble Shooting\nIf charging does not separate the two leaves sufficiently, take these corrective\nactions:\nI. Besure the pieces ofanhydrite in the bottom of the ionizationchamber(the\ncan) are in a single layer, with no piece on top of another and the top of no\npiece more than Ij2 inch above the bottom of the can.\n2. Check to besure thatthe threads suspendingthe leavesare not crossed; then\ntry to charge the KFM again.\n3. If the KFM still cannot be charged, replace the used anhydrite with fresh\nanhydrite.\n4.

If you cannot charge the KFM while in an area of heavy fallout, take it to\nthe place affordingthe best protectionagainst radiation, and try to charge it\nthere. (A dose rate of several hundred Rj hr will neutralize the charges on\nboth the chargingdevice and the instrument so rapidly that a KFM cannot\nbe charged.)\nIf a KFM or other radiation measuring instrument gives unexpectedly high\nreadings inside a good shelter, wipeall dust off the outside ofthe instrumentand\nrepeat the radiation-measurements. Especially when exposing a fallout meter\noutdoors where there isfresh fallout, keep the instrument ina lidded pot, plastic\nbag, or other covering to avoid the possibility of having it contaminated with\nfallout particlesand afterwardsgetting erroneously high radiation measurements.\nz\nV\u003E\n-l::tlc:q\n(5\nZ\nV\u003E\n;;,0\n00\n(b\n00\nIV\nW\no","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":254,"content":"I\nm\nCla..","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":255,"content":"3.

Reduce the length of two ordinary plastic bread bags (or similar\nplastic bags) to a length that is5inches greater than the height ofthe\nbucket. (Do not use rubber gloves in place of bags; gloves so used\nresult in much more humid outside air being unintentionally pumped\ninto a dry-bucket when it is being used while charging a KFM inside\nit.)\n7. Insert a plastic bag into each hand-hole, and fold the edge of the\nplastic bag about 1/2 inch over the taped vertical \u0022wall\u0022 around\neach hand-hole.\n8. Strengthen the upper parts of the plastic bags by folding 2-inch\npieces oftape over the top ofthe \u0022wall\u0022 around each hand-hole.\n9. Make about a quart of anhydrite by heating small pieces of\nwall-board gypsum, and keep this anhydrite dry in a Mason jar or\notherairtightcontainerwith a rubber or plastic sealer.\n10. Make a circular aluminum-foil cover to place over the plastic cover\nwhen the dry-bucket is not being used for minutes to hours. Make\nthis cover with a diameter about 4 inches greater than the diameter\nof the top of the bucket, and make it fit more snugly with an\nencircling loop of rubber bands, or with string.

(Unrolling a roll\nof tape inside a dry-bucket is an impractical charging\nmethod.)\n12. Expose the KFM to fallout radiation either by:\na. Leaving the KFM inside the dry-bucket while exposing it to\nfallout radiation for one of the listed time intervals, and\nreading the KFM before and after the exposure while it\nremains inside the dry-bucket. (The reading eye should be a\nmeasured 12 inches above the SEAT of the KFM, and a\nflashlight or other light should be used.)\nb. Taking the charged KFM out of the dry-bucket to read it,\nexpose it, and read it after the exposure. (If this is done\nrepeatedly, especially in a humid shelter, the drying agent\nwillnot be effective for many KFM chargings, and willhave to\nbe replaced.)\nXV. Howto Use a KFM aftera NuclearAttack\nA. Background Information\nIfduring a rapidly worsening crisis threatening nuclear war you are in the\nplace where you \u0027plan to take shelter, postpone studying the instructions\nfollowing this sentence until after you have:\n(1) built or improved a high-protection-factor shelter (if\npossible, a shelter covered with 2 or 3 ft of earth and\nseparatefrom flammable buildings), and\n(2) made a KAP (homemade shelter-ventilating pump) if you\nhave the instructions and materials, and\n(3) stored at least 15gallons ofwaterfor each shelter occupant if\nyou can obtaincontainers.\nHavinga KFM or any other dependable fallout meter and knowing how to\noperate it will enable you to minimize radiation injuries and possible\nfatalities, especially by skillfully using a high-protection-factor fallout\nshelter to control and limit exposures to radiation. By studying this\nsection youfirst willieam how to measure radiation dose rates (roentgens\nper hour =R/hr), how to calculate doses [R] received in different time\nintervals, and how to determine time Interval. (hours and/or minutes) in\nwhich specified doses would be received. Then this section lists the sizes\nofdoses (numberofR) that the average person can tolerate without being\nsickened, that he is likely to survive, and that he is likely to be killed by.\nzVl\n-l::cc:q\nSzVl\n;.p\n()Q\n(1)\nN\no\ntvwtv","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":258,"content":"C)\na..\nC)\na..","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":259,"content":"tv\nW\nW\nz\nVl....,\n:;0\nc:(j....,\noz\nVl\n-es:o\n\\JQ\n(\u0027l\nN.....\nh\n6\n8\no\n3\n5\n8\nTABLE USED TO FIND DOSE RATES IR/HR\nFROM KFM READINGS\n\u0027DiffERENCE BETWEEN rHE REAOI\u0022lG BEfORE EXPQSuR/\nAND THE READING AF rER EXPOSuRE \u0027BPt Y srAfV[JARp\nFOIL LEAVESI\n01FF.\u0027 IN TIME INTERVAL OF AN EXPOSUR\nREAD\u00B7 15 SEC. 1 MIN. 4MIN. 16MIN. 1 HF\nINGS R/HR R/HR R/HR R/HR R/HI\n2mm 6.2 1.6 0.4 0.1 00\n4mm 12. 3.1 0.8 0.2 0.0\n6mm 19. 4.6 1.2 0.3 0.0\n8mm 25. 62 16 0.4 0.1\n10 mm 31. 7.7 2.0 05 0.1\n12 mm 37. 9.2 2.3 0.6 0.1\n14 mm 43. 11. 2.7 0.7 01\nIfan exposure results inthe readingafter the exposure being lessthan5\nmm, recharge the KFM and expose itagainfor one ofthe shortertime\nintervals listed.\n4. Expose the KFM to fallout radiation for one of the time intervals\nshown inthe vertical columns of the table attached to the KFM. (Study\nthe following table.) Ifthe dose rate isnot known even approximately.\nfirst expose the fully charged KFM for one minute. For dependable\nmeasurements outdoors. expose the charged KFM about 3feet above\nthe ground. The longer outdoor exposures usually are best made by\nattaching the KFM with 2strong rubber bands to a stick or pole. being\ncareful never to tilt the KFM too much.\n5. Read the KFM after the exposure. while the KFM rests on an\napproximately horizontal surface.\n6. Find the time interval that givesa dependable reading - by exposing\nthe fullycharged KFM for one or more ofthe listed time intervals until\nthe reading after the exposure is;\n(ajNot lessthan 5 mm.\n(b) At least 2 mm lessthan the reading before the exposure.\n7. Calculate by simple subtraction the difference in the apparent\nseparation of the lower edges of the leaves before the exposure and\nafter the exposure. Anexample: Ifthe reading before the exposure is18\nmm and the reading after the exposure is 6 mm, the difference in\nreadings is 18mm - 6 mm = 12mm.\n8. If an exposure results in a difference in readings of less than 2 mm,\nrecharge the KFM and expose it again for one of the longer time\nintervals listed. (If there appears to be no difference in the readings\ntaken before and afteran exposurefor one minute. this does not prove\nthere is absolutely no fallout danger. Take a longer reading.)\n10. Use the table attached to the\nKFM to find the dose rate\n(RI hr) during the time of ex-\nposure. The dose rate (Rjhr) is\nfound at the intersection of the\nvertical column of numbers\nunder the time interval used\nand of the horizontal line of\nnumbers that lists the calcu-\nlated difference in readings at\nits left end.\nAn example: Ifthe time interval of the exposure was 1 MIN. and the\ndifference inthe readings was 12mm, the table shows that the dose rate\nduring the time interval of the exposure was 9.2 R/HR (9.2 roentgens\nper hour).\nAnotherexample: Ifthe time intervalofthe exposure was 15SEC.and\nthe difference in readings was 11mm, the table showsthatthe dose rate\nduring the exposure was halfway between 31 R/HR and 37 R/HR;\nthat is, the dose rate was 34 RI hr.\n9.\nB. Finding the Dose Rate\n1. Reread Section IV,\u0022Whata KFM Isand How it Works.\u0022Also reread\nSection XIII. \u0022Two Ways to Charge a KFM,\u0022 and actually do each\nstep immediately after reading it.\n2. Chargethe KFM sothat it reads atleast 15mm. Nextraise the\nlower end of the charging wire. Then gently bump or shake\nthe KFM to remove any unstable part of the charge. Read the\napparentseparationof the loweredgesof the leaveswhile the\nKFM rests on an approximately horizontal surface. If the\nreading is larger than 20 mm, bleed off enough charge to\nreduce the initial reading to 20 mm or slightly less, for\nmaximum accuracy. Never take a reading while a leaf is\ntouching a stop-thread.\n3. To prevent possible contamination of a KFM (or of any other fallout\nmeter) with fallout particles, keep it inside a plastic bag or other\ncovering whenthere isrisk offallout particles beingdeposited or blown\nonto it. An instrumentcontaminated withfallout particles can givetoo\nhigh readings, especially of the low dose-rate measurements made\ninside a good shelter.\nIn places where fallout arrives several hours after the explosion, the\nradioactivity of the fallout will have gone through its time period of.most\nrapid decay while the fallout particles were still airborne. If you are in a\nlocation so distant from the explosion that fallout arrives 8 hours after the\nexplosion, two days must pass before the initial dose rate measured at\nyour location willdecay to 1/10 its initial intensity.\nMost fortunately for the future of all livitlg things. the decay of\nradioactivity causes the sandlike fallout particleS to become less and less\ndangerous with the passage oftime. Each fallout particle acts much like a\ntiny Xray machine would if it were made so that its rays. shooting out\nfrom it likeinvisible light. became weaker and weaker with time.\nContrary to exaggerated accounts of fallout dangers, the radiation dose\nrate from fallout particles when they reach the ground in the areas of the\nheaviest fallout will decrease quite rapidly. For example, consider the\ndecay of fallout from a relatively nearby, large surface burst, at a place\nwhere the fallout particles are deposited on the ground one hour after the\nexplosion. At this time one hour after the explosion, assume that the\nradiation dose rate (the best measure of radiation danger at a particular\ntime) measures 2,000 roentgens per hour (2,000 R/hr) outdoors. Seven\nhours later the dose rate is reduced to 200 R/hr by normal radioactive\ndecay. Twodays after the explosion, the dose rate outdoors is reduced by\nradioactive decay to 20R/hr. After twoweeks, the dose rate is less than 2\nR/hr. When the dose rate is 2 Rzhr, people can go out of a good shelter\nand workoutdoors for 3 hours a day, receiving a daily dose of 6 roentgens.\nwithout being sickened.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":260,"content":"CJ)\na..\nCJ)\na..","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":261,"content":"II.\n12.\nNote in the table that if an exposure for one ofthe listed time\nintervals causes the dJfference in readings to be 2 mm or 3\nmrn, then an exposure 4times as long reveals the same dose\nrate. An example: If a 1-min exposure results in a\ndifference in readings of2 mm, the table shows the dose rate\nwas 1.6 R/hr; then if the KFM is exposed for 4 minutes at\nthis same dose rate of 1.6 R/hr, the table shows that the\nresultant difference in readings is 8 mm.\nThe longer exposure results in a more accurate\ndetermination ofthe dose rate.\nIfthe dose rate isfound to be greater than 0.2 R/hr and time\nis available, recharge the KFM and repeat the dose-rate\nmeasurement --to avoid possible mistakes.\nAnother example: Assume that three days after an attack the occupants\nof a dry, hot cave giving almost complete protection against fallout are in\ndesperate need ofwater. The dose rate outside is found to be 20 R/hr. To\nbackpack water from a source 3 miles away is estimated to take 2-112\nhours. The cave occupants estimate that the water backpackers will\nreceive a dose in 2-112 hours ofSO R (2.5 hr x 20 R/hr = SO R). A dose of\nSO R will cause only mild symptoms (nausea in about 10% of persons\nreceiving a SO R dose) for persons who previously have received only very\nsmall doses. Therefore, one ofthe cave occupants makes a rapid radiation\nsurveyfor about 1-112 miles along the proposed route, stopping to charge\nand read a KFM about every quarter of a mile. He finds no dose rates\nmuch higher than 20 R/hr.\nSo, the cave occupants decide the risk is small enough to justify some of\nthem leaving shelterfor about 2-112 hours to get water.\nFortunately, the human body -- if given enough time -- can repair most of\nthe damage caused by radiation. An historic example: A healthy man\naccidently received a daily dose of 9.3 R (or somewhat more) of\nfallout-type radiation each day for a period of 106 days. His total\naccumulated dose was at least 1000R. A dose of one thousand roentgens,\nif received in a few days, is almost three times the dose likely to kill the\naverage man if he receives the whole dose in a few days and after a\nnuclear attack cannot get medical treatment, adequate rest, etc.\nHowever, the only symptomthis man noted was seriousfatigue.\nThe occupants ofa high-protection-factor shelter (such as a trench shelter\ncovered with 2 or 3 feet of earth and having crawlway entrances) would\nreceive less than 11200 ofthe radiation dose theywould receive outside.\nEven in most areas of very heavy fal1out, persons who remain continously\nin such a shelter would receive a total accumulated dose of less than 2S R\nin the first day after the attack, and less than 100R in the first two weeks.\nAt the end of the first two weeks, such shelter occupants could start\nworking outside for an increasing length of time each day, receiving a\ndaily dose of no more than 6 R for up to two months without being\nsickened.\nC.. Calculating the Dose Received\nThe dose of fallout radiation -- that is, the amount of fallout radiation\nreceived -- determines the harmful effects on men and animals. Being\nexposed to a high dose rate is not always dangerous -- provided the\nexposure is shortenough to result in only a small dose being received. For\nexample, if the dose rate outside an excellent fallout shelter is 1200 R/hr\nand a shelter occupant goes outside for 30 seconds; he would be exposed\nfor 112of 1 minute, or 112 of 1160of an hour, which equals 11120 hour.\nTherefore, since the dose he would receive ifhe stayed outside for 1 hour\nwould be 1200 R, in 30 seconds he would receive 11120 of 1200, which\nequals 10R(1200Rdivided by 120 = 10 R). Atotal daily dose of 10 R (10\nroentgens) will not cause any symptoms if it is not repeated day after day\nfor a week or more.\nIn contrast, if the average dose rate of an area were found to be 12 R/hr\nand if a person remained exposed in that particular area for 24 hours, he\nwould receive a dose of 288 R(12 R/hr x 24 hr =288 R). Even assuming\nthat this person had beenexposed previously to very little radiation, there\nwould stilI be a serious risk that this 288 Rclosewould be fatal under the\ndifficult conditions thatwould fol1ow a heavy nuclear attack.\nD.

Then promptly\nmeasure the dose rate outside. The uncontaminated shelter\u0027s\nPF = Dose Rate Outside\nDose Rate Inside\nAn example: If the dose rate inside is found to be 0.2 Rlhr and the\n\u0027dose rate outside is 31 Rlhr, the shelter\u0027s\nPF = 31 Rlhr =155\n0.2 Rlhr\nThen at future times the approximate dose rate outside can be\nfound by measuringthe dose rate inside and multiplyingitby 155.\nApproximate Dose Rate Outside =Dose Rate Inside x PF.\nF. Using a KFM to Reduce Radiation Doses Received\nIf a charged KFM is discharged and reads zero within a secondor\ntwo after being taken outside a good shelter, this means that the\ndose rate outside is hundreds of roentgens per hour. Get back\ninside! Also remember that a 15-second reading is not as accurate\nas are readings made in longer specified exposure times.\nInside most shelters, the dose received by an occupant varies considerably,\ndepending on the occupant\u0027s location. For example, inside an expedient\ncovered-trenchshelterthedose rate ishigher near theentrancethan inthe middle\nof the trench. In a typical basement shelter the best protection is found in one\ncorner. Especiallyduring the first several hours after thearrivaloffallout, when\nthe dose rates and doses receivedare highest, shelter occupants should use their\nfallout meters todetermine whereto placethemselvesto minimizethe dosesthey\nreceive.\nThey should useavailable tools and materials to reduce the doses they receive,\n.especially during the first day, by digging deeper (if practical) and reducing the\nsize of openings by partially blocking them with earth, water containers, etc.\n- while maintaining adequate ventilation. To greatly reduce the slight risk of\nfallout particles entering the body through nose or mouth, shelter occupants\nshould cover nose and mouth with a towel or other cloth while the fallout is\nbeing deposited outside their shelter, ifat the same time ventilating air isbeing\nblown or pumped through their shelter.\nThe air inside an occupied shelter often becomes very humid. Ifa good flow of\noutdoorair isflowing into a shelter - especiallyifpumped bybrieflyoperatinga\nKAP or otherventilating pump- a KFM usuallycan becharged at theair intake\nofthe shelter room without puttingitinsidea dry-bucket. However, ifthe air to\nwhich a KFM is exposed has a relative humidity of 90% or higher, the\ninstrument cannot be charged, even by quickly unrolling a roll of tape.\nInextensive areas of heavyfallout, the occupants ofmost home basements,that\nprovide inadequateshieldingagainstheavyfallout radiation, would beindeadly\ndanger. Byusingadependablefallout meter, occupantswould find that persons\nlyingon the floor incertainlocationswould receivethe smallestdoses, and that,\nifthey improvise additionalshieldinginthese locations, thedoses receivedcould\nbegreatly reduced. Additionalshieldingcan beprovided bymakinga verysmall\nshelter insidethe basementwhere the dose rate isfound to belowest. Furniture,\nboxes, etc.can beusedfor walls,doorsfor the roof, and watercontainers,books,\nand other heavy objects for shielding - especially on the roof. Or, if tools are\navailable, breaking through the basement floor and digginga shelter trench will\ngreatly increase available protection against radiation. If a second expedient\nventilatingpump, a KAP, (ora smallDirectionalFan), ismadeand usedasa\nfan, such an extremely cramped shelter inside a shelter usually can be occupied\nby several times as many persons as can occupy it without forced\nventilation.\nEND OF INSTRUCTIONS\nzVl\n-l\n:::0\nc::::(J\n-l\n(3\nZVl\n\u0027i:IIII\n\u003Cro\n(l)\nNW\nNW\nVI","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":264,"content":"0\u003Ea..\nI\nC\\I\n~\n0\u003Ea..","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":265,"content":"H\ntt:l Z\n:\u003E\u003CCf.l\nt-3t-3\n~~\n(\u0022)\n\u0022\u0027dt-3\ng:;~\ntt:lZ\nCf.l\nl\u0026I\n~\n..,J\nu\ns\n..,J\nq:\n~\n:::\u003EU\n~ l\u0026I\n~ ~\nl\u0026. ..,J\no u\n~ ~q: 0\nl\u0026I ..,J\nl/) q:\nl\u0026I ~\nQ :::\u003E\niii U\n/\nBOTTOM OF CAN (ABOVE LIP)\n\u002B,--HOLES FOR STOP\u00B7THREAD ~\u002B\nORNL\u00B7DWG 76-6535\n\u0027--\nI\n~\n..,J\nCl::\n~\n~\n~\nI\n\u0027\u0022 TOP OF CAN (BELOW LIP)\n~ FASTEN THREADS HOLDING ALUMINUM LEAVES HERE\nI\nI ,.

In\nan attack on militarily relevant targets, as much\nas 5o/c; of the total area of the 48 states could be\nsubjected to blast damage severe enough to destroy or\ndamage homes - depending on the number of\nwarheads assigned to each hard target, weapon\nreliability, etc. If blast shelters affording protection up\nto the 15-pounds-per-square-inch (15 psi) overpressure\nrange were available to everybody and were occu-\npied at the time of attack, the great majority of\nthe occupants would survive all blast, fire, and\nradiation effects in the blast areas subjected to\nless than 15-psi blast effects.\nFifteen-psi blast shelters will survive as\nclose as about 1.5 miles from ground zero of a\n1-megaton surface burst, and about 2.3 miles\nfrom ground zero or a 1-megaton air burst.\nExcept in high-density urban areas where the\nair supply openings andexits of shelters are all\ntoo likelyto be coveredwith blast-hurleddebris,\nthe area in which people inside good earth-\ncovered 15-psi blast shelters would be killed\nwould be onlyabout 1/6th as large as theareain\nwhich most people sheltered in typicalAmeri-\ncan homes probably would die from blast and\nfire effects alone.\nBlast tests have indicated that the Small-\nPole Shelter (the most blast-resistant of the\nearth-covered expedient shelters described in\nAppendix A) should enable its occupants to\nsurviveup to the50-psioverpressure range - if\nbuilt with the blast-resistant and radiation-\nprotective features described in following sec-\ntions, and if located outside an urban area.\nCalculations show that this earth-covered ex-\npedient blast shelter also would give adequate\nprotection atthe50-psiblastoverpressure range\nagainstthe intenseinitialnuclearradiationthat\nis emitted from the fireball of a 1-megaton\nexplosion. However, to make this shelter (see\npage 258) provide adequate protection against\nthe even more intense initial nuclear radiation\nthat would reach the 50-psi overpressure range\nfrom thefireballofa500-kilotonorsmallerexplo-\nsion, it should have at least 6 feet ofearth cover\nand additional cans of water should be kept\nready to be placed in the horizontal parts of the\nentrywayspromptlyafterthe shelterisoccupied.\nThe life-saving potential of well designed, well\nbuilt blast shelters is a demonstrated fact. Millions of\nAmericans living in high-risk areas would be able to\nbuild expedient blast shelters within only a few days-\nprovided they weregivenfield-tested instructions,\nhad made some preparations before the crisis\narose, had a few days of recognized warning,\nand during the crisis were motivated by the\nPresident. The following information is given in the\nhope ofencouraging more Americans to make prepara-\ntions for blast protection. Also, it may serve to increase\nthe number who realize the need for permanent blast\nshelters in high-risk blast areas.\nSome informed citizens-particularly those who\nlive near large cities or in their outer suburbs-may\nchoose to build earth-covered expedient blast shelters\nin their backyards, rather than to evacuate. Going into\na strange area and trying to build or find good shelter\n. and otheressentials of lifewould entail risks that many\npeople might hesitate to take, particularly if they live\noutside the probable areas of severe blast damage. For\nsuch citizens, the best decision might be to stay at\nhome, build earth-covered expedient blast shelters,\nsupplythem with the essentials for long occupancy, and\nremain with their possessions.\nThe following descriptions of the characteristics\nand components of expedient blast shelters should\nenable many readers to use locally available materials\nto provide at least 15-psi blast protection. Pre-crisis\npreparations are essential, as wellas the abilityto work\nveryhard for two to four days.

This shelter withstood blast\nand fire at an overpressure range of about 65 psi.

A small, earth-covered backyard\nshelter with a crude wooden frame-undamaged,\nalthough only 300 yards from ground zero at\nHiroshima.\nAlthough the shelter itself was undamaged, its\noccupants would have been fatally injured because\nthe shelter had no blast door. The combined effect of\nblast waves, excessive pressure, blast wind, and burns\nfrom extremely hot dust blown into the shelter (the\npopcorning effect) and from the heated air would\nhave killed the occupants. For people to survive in\nareas of severe blast, their shelters must have strong\nblast doors.\nIn nuclear weapons tests in the Nevada desert,\nbox-like shelters built of lumber and covered with\nsandy earth were structurally undamaged by 10- to\n15-psi blast effects. However, none had blast doors,\nso occupants of these open shelters would have been\ninjured by blast effects and burned as a result of the\npopcorning effect. Furthermore, blast winds blew\naway much ofthe dry, sandyearth mounded over the\nshelters for shielding; this resulted in inadequate\nprotection against fallout radiation.\nTwelve different types ofexpedient shelterswere\nblast-tested by Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nduring three of Defense NuclearAgency\u0027s blast tests.5\nTwo of these tests each involved the detonation of a\nmillion pounds or more of conventional explosive;\nair-blast effects equivalent to those from a l-kiloton\nnuclear surface burst were produced by these\nchemical explosions.\nSeveral of these shelters had expedient blast\ndoors which were closed during the tests.

(The reader should remember that\neven if shelters without blast doors are undamaged,\nthe occupants are likely to suffer injuries.)\nCONSTRUCTION PRINCIPLES\nMillions of Americans-if given good instruc-\ntions, strong motivation, and several days to\nwork-should be able to build blast shelters with\nmaterials found in many rural areas and suburban\nneighborhoods. During a crisis, yard trees could be\ncut down for poles and sticks, and a garage or part of\na house could be torn down for lumber. Many\naverage citizens could build expedient blast shelters if\nthey learn to:\n\u2022 Utilize earth arching by making a yielding\nshelter. The remarkable protection that eartharching\ngives to those parts of a shelter designed to use it is\nillustrated by Fig. D.3.\nThis picture shows the unbroken roof of a 4-\nfoot-wide Pole-Covered Trench Shelter that was\nFig. D.3. Effective earth arching in the earth\ncovering of this 4-ft-wide Pole-Covered Trench\nShelter prevented a single pole from being broken by\nblast forces that exerted a downward force of 53 psi\n(over 31/2 tons per square foot) on the overlying\nearth.\nbuilt in rock-like soil and blast tested where the blast\npressure outside was 53 psi. Its strong blast doors\nprevented the blast wave from entering. Without the\nprotection of earth arching that developed in the 5\nfeet of earth cover over the yielding roof poles, the\npoles would have been broken like straws. In\ncontrast, the ground shock and earth pressure\nproduced by l-kiloton blast effects almost com-\npletely collapsed the unsupported, rock-like earth\nwalls.\nFig. D.4. Post-blast interior of an Above-\nground, Door-Covered Shelter that survived l-kilo-\nton blasteffects at the 5.8-psi overpressurerange. The\nshelter walls were made of bedsheets containing\nearth, as described in Appendix A.\nFigure D.4 also indicates the effectiveness\nof earth arching. This photo shows the roof of a\nsmall, earth-covered fallout shelter, as it appeared\nafter surviving blast effects severe enough to\ndemolish most homes. The roof was made of light,\nhollow-core, interior doors and looks as though it\nhad been completely broken. In fact, only the lower\nsheets of l/s-inch-thick veneer of the hollow-core\ninterior doors were broken. (These breaks were\ncaused by a faulty construction procedure-a front-\nend loader had dumped several tons ofearth onto the\nuncovered doors.) The upper l/s-inch-thick sheets of\nveneer were bowed downward, unbroken, until an\nearth arch formed in the 2-foot-thick earth covering\nand prevented the thin sheets from being broken.\nEarth arching also prevented this roof from being\nsmashed in by blast overpressure that exerted a\npressure of 5.8 psi (835 pounds per square foot) on\nthe surface of the earth mounded over this open\nshelter.

This limitationwas confirmed by\nan identical shelter tested at 7 psi; parts of its\nunshored walls were quite badly collapsed by the\nground shock from an explosion producing merely\nl-kiloton blast effects.\nFig. 0.6.

Blast tests have indicated that a\nPole-Covered Trench Shelter thus proportioned and\nlightly shored should protect its occupants against\ndisastrous collapse of its wallsat overpressure ranges\nup to 15 psi.\n\u2022 In firm, stable earth, it is best first to dig a\ntrench a few incheswider than 7feet(the length ofthe\nroof poles) and I foot deep.

A large KAP can\npump air at the rate ofseveral thousand cubicfeet per\nminute through such open doors.\nWhen an attack is expected, each pull-cord\nshould be held by a shelter occupant who stays ready\nat all times to yank out the prop-stick as soon as he\nsees the light of an explosion. After the door has\nfallen closed, the loop at the end of its wire bridle is\nclose to the upper hook ofthe load-binder and at the\nsame height (Fig. D.14).

For a 20-\nmegaton surface burst, the warning time at the IS-psi\nrange is about 8 seconds, and at the 30-psi over-\npressure range, about 4 seconds.

Also keep in mind that the \u0022suction\u0022 that\nfollows can exert an outwardly directed force of up to\n700 pounds per square foot on the valve face and can\nyank it out of position unless it is securely installed.\nFigure 0.19shows how to securely install a blast valve.\n(Merely nailing a blast valve in its opening will not\nenable it to withstand severe blast forces.)\nNote in Figure D.19 that an opening is\nshown between the back edge of the uppermost\nboard of the Overlapping-Flaps BlastValve and\nthe adjacenthorizontalpoleofthe verticalentry.\nBoth this opening and the similar opening next\nto thelowermostboardoftheBlastValve should\nbe closed off with a stout board, to prevent blast\nfrom going through these openings and on into\na vertical entry and the shelter room.\nThetop ofan airshaftshouldbe a few inches\nhigher than the earth piled around it, as are the\ntops of the vertical entries of the Small-Pole\nShelter illustrated in Figure A.3.1 on page 174.\nTo minimize the amount of rain that may fall\ninto an air shaft, a shed-like, open-sided minia-\nture roof should be placed over it, a few inches\naboveitstop.Theroofcanbe lightlyconstructed,\nsince it will be blown away by a severe blast.\n\u2022 Minimize aboveground construction and the\nmounding of shielding earth. At high overpressure\nranges, the shock wave and the blast-wind drag can\nwreck an aboveground shelter entry. For example, the\n5-ft-high earth mound over a shelter built with its pole\nroof at ground level was moved enough by l-kiloton\nair-blast effects at the 53-psi overpressure range to\nbreak one of the poles ofa blast-doorframe. The forces\nof a I-megaton explosion at the same overpressure\nrange would have operated 10 times as long, and\nprobably would havesmashed the vertical entryways of\nthis shelter. Whenever practical, a blast shelter should\nbe built far enough belowground so that the top of its\nshieldingearthcover isat ground level.Avoidingabove-\nground construction and earth mounds also greatly\nreduces the chances of damage from blast-hurled,\nheavydebris, such astree trunksand piecesof buildings.\nDry earth, steeply mounded over a shelter which is\nsubjected to blast winds from a big explosion, will be\nmostly blown away.

The blast winds from a l-kiloton\nexplosionat the 31-psioverpressurerange scoured away\n17inches of dry, sandy soil mounded at a slope of 32\u00B0.\nIf it is impractical to build a blast shelter with its\nroof belowground, good protection can be attained by\nmoundingeven dry earthat slopes not steeper than 10\u00B0.\n\u2022 Provide adequate shielding against initial nuclear\nradiation. Good expedient blast shelters require a\ngreater thickness of earth cover than is needed on good\nfallout shelters, for these reasons:\n* Blast shelters should also protect against initial\nnuclear radiation emitted by the fireball. This\nradiation is reduced by half when it penetrates\nabout 5inches of packed earth (as compared to\na halving-thickness of only about 3Y2 inches of\nearth against radiation from fallout).\n* The initial radiation, in some areas where good\nblast shelters will survive, can be much greater\nthan the fallout radiation is likely to be.\n* Initial nuclear radiation that comes through\nentryways ismore difficult to attenuate(reduce)\nthan fallout radiation. Therefore, longer entry-\nways or additional right-angle turns must be\nprovided.\nFor these reasons, good blast shelters should be\ncovered with at least 4ft ofwell-packed, average-weight\nearth, or 5 ft of unpacked or light earth. (A 3-ft\nthickness gives excellent protection against radiation\nfrom fallout.)\nA 50-PSI SMALL-POLE SHELTER\nThis expedient blast shelterisdescribed indetail to\nenable the reader to build this model. The details will\nhelp him better understand the design principles of\nother expedient blast shelters that are capable of\npreventing injuries from blast effects severe enough to\ndestroy all ordinary buildings and kill the occupants.\nBlast tests and calculations have indicated that the\nSmall-Pole Shelter described and illustrated in Appen-\ndix A.3 willafford protection againstall weaponeffects\nat overpressureranges up to 50psithatare produced by\nan explosion of 1 megaton, or larger, provided the\nshelter is:\n\u2022 Made with horizontal entryways each .with\nceilings no higher than 7 ft, 2 in., no wider than 3 ft,\nand each at least 10 ft long-to lessen the radiation\ncoming through the \u0027entries (see Fig. 0.20).

(At the 50-psi over-\npressure range from explosions smaller than one\nmegaton, the entry and shielding shown in Fig. 0.20\nmay not provide adequate protection against initial\nnuclear radiation.) .\nWhen the shelter is readied for rapid occupancy,\nthe shelter-ventilating KAP is secured against the\nceiling. and the bags of earth in the doorway (under\nthe KAP) are removed. Persons entering the shelter\nwould stoop to go under the platform adjacent to the\nvertical entry. This platform is attached to vertical\nwall-poles of the horizontal entry and supports\nshielding waterand earth. When all except the person\nwho will shut and secure the blast door are inside the\nshelter room, occupants should quickly begin to\nplace bags of earth in the doorway. When the attack\nhas begun, the whole doorway can be closed with\nbags of earth or other dense objects until ventilation\nis necessary.\nThe entries of other types of blastshelterscan be\nshielded in similar ways.\n\u2022 Protected against fire by being built sufficiently\ndistant from buildingsand flammable vegetation and\nby having its exposed wood covered. For maximum\nexpedient protection against ignition by the thermal\nradiation from a large explosion, all exposed wood\nshould be free ofbark, coated with wet mud or damp\nslaked lime (whitewash), and covered with aluminum\nsheet metal or foil to reflect heat. (Most of the\nthermal radiation from an explosion that was\nI megaton or larger would reach the 50-psi over-\npressure range after the blast wave had arrived and\nhad torn the expedient protective coverings from the\nwood. However, as has been observed in megaton\nnuclearweapon tests, the dustcloud first produced by\nthe popcorning effect and later by the blast winds\nwould screen solid wood near the ground so\neffectively against thermal radiation that itwould not\nbe ignited, provided it had been initially protected as\ndescribed above.)\nPRECAUTIONS FOR OCCUPANTS\nOF BLAST SHELTERS\nAlthough a wellconstructed blastsheltermay be\nundamaged at quite high overpressure ranges, its\noccupants may be injured or killed as a result of rapid\nground motions that move the whole shelter several\ninches in a few thousandths of a second. Rapid\nground motions are not likely to cause serious\ninjuries unless the shelterisinan area subjected to 30-\npsi or greaterblast effects. To prevent possible injury,\nwhen the occupants of high-protection blast shelters\nare expecting attack they should avoid:\n\u2022 Having their heads close to the ceiling. The \u0022air\nslap\u0022 of the air-blast wave may push down the earth\nand an undamaged shelter much more rapidly thana\nperson can fall. If one\u0027s head were to be only a few\ninches from the ceiling, a fractured skull could result.\n\u2022 Leaning against a wall, because it may move\nvery rapidly, horizontally as well as vertically.\n\u2022 Sitting or standing on the floor, because ground\nshock may cause the whole shelter (including the\nfloor) to rise very fast and injure persons sitting or\nstanding on the floor. The safest thingto do isto sit or\nlie in a securely suspended, stronghammock or chair,\nor on thick foam rubber such as that ofa mattress, or\non a pile of small branches.\nIn dry areas or inadry expedientshelter, ground\nshock may produce choking dust. Therefore, shelter\noccupants should be prepared to cover their faces\nwith towels or other cloth, or put on a mask. If an\nattack is expected, they should keep such protective\nitems within easy reach.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":294,"content":"","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":295,"content":"Appendix E\nHow to Make and Use a Homemade\nPlywood Double-Action Piston Pump and Filter\nTHE :-iEED\n\\.entilating pumps-mostly centrifugal blowers capable ofoperat-\ning against quite high resistance toairflow-are used to force outdoor\nair through most high-protection-factor fallout shelters and through\nalmost all permanent blastshelters.

An excellent foreign blower that enables one man to\npump somewhat larger volumes sells for about twice as much.\n2. Not enough centrifugal blowers could be manufactured quickly\nenough to equip all shelters likely to be built during a recognized\ncrisis threatening nuclear attack, and lasting for weeks to several\nmonths.\nTherefore, there is need for an efficient. manually operated, low-\ncost ventilating pump that:\nI.

Then the greatereffectiveness\nof a piston pump for ventilating a shelter with a high-resistance\nair-supplysystem will be even more important than when its filter\nis clean.\nThe horsepower requirements of my pump have not yet been\nmeasured. However, basedon the calculated air pressureon the 12\nx 12-in. piston of 22.3Ibs. when the pressure difference was 4.3 in.\nw.g, (0.155 psi), when two pumpers were making 52 strokes\n(cycles) per minute while pumping 182 cfm, the horsepower\ndelivered was about 0.14 HP without allowing for friction and the\nlosses of power due to reversals in the directions of piston\nmovements. Iestimate thatthe actual horsepower delivered by the\ntwo pumpers (I, a 69 year old with a stiff back in 1983, and a\n15-year-old boy) was somewhat less than 0.2 HP. A man in good\ncondition can work for hours delivering 0.1 HP.\nWhen comparing machines powered by human muscles, what\nmuscles are used and how they are used are often as important as\nare the horsepower requirements. Leg muscles are more efficient\nand are much stronger than arm muscles. Arm muscles are used\nmuch_more in cranking a blower than in pushing and pulling the\npiston of a properly designed reciprocating piston pump back and\nforth horizontally. See Fig. 3. Ifthis double-action piston pump is\nplaced at a height above the floor so that its handle is approxi-\nmately at the height of a standing operator\u0027s elbows, then the\noperator can do most of the work with his legs. See Fig. 3. He\nefficiently moves his body back and forth for over a foot, while\nmoving his hands and forearms horizontally for slightly less than a\nfoot relative to his body. To deliver the same horsepower by\ncranking a blower uses less efficient muscles inefficiently, and is\nmuch more tiring.\nAs shown in Table 2, the volumetric efficiency of my best model\nis good for a shelter-ventilating pump. The volumetric efficiency\nof a piston pump (a positive displacement pump) is found by\ndividing the cfrn actually pumped by the theoretical maximum\ncfm at the same pumping rate and the same pressure difference,\nassumingall piston strokesare full length, that all valvesopen and\nclose instantaneously, and that there is no leakage. Table 2 shows\nthat the greater the pressuredifference, the lower the efficiency-\nas one would expect, because of increased leakage.\nDouble-Action\nPiston Pump\none man\ntwo men\nTemet Oy\nCentrifugal Blower\ntwo men\nDouble-Action\nPiston Pump\none man\ntwo men\nTemet Oy\nCentrifugal Blower\ntwo men\nFig. 3.

I bave converted\nTemet Oy\u0027s metric units into the common American units.\nInTable 1the pressure difference of 4.3 inches water gauge is the\nresistance to airflow that Temet Oy realistically gives as typical of a\nwell designed shelter ventilation system of pipes, valves and blower\nplus a Chemical Biological Radiological (CBR) filter. Temet Oygives\n2.0 inches water gauge as typical of the same ventilation system\nwith only a low resistance dust filter.

The filters that give the best protection, Chemical Biological\nRadiological (CBR) Filters, have quite high resistance to airflow, as\ndocommercial blastvalves thatclosequicklyenough to protectfilters,\n1. Volumetric tests, Because the rapidly pulsating airflows into\nand outofa piston pumpare very hard to measure accurately with an\nair velocity meter, I made an inflatablecylindrical bagof2-mil(0.002\ninch) polyethylene film; the fully inflated volume of this bag was 256\ncubic feet. The bag was suspended on a horizontal strong cord\nrunning through its length. A short tube 62 inches in circumference\nconnected the back end of the pump (that is opposite the operator\u0027s\nend) to the suspended bag. Bag and pump were in a below ground\nshelter that normally has essentially motionless air. See Fig. 1.\nSince this type of pump exhausts equal volumes of air from each of\nits two ends, the total cubic feet per minute(cfm) that it pumpsequals\ntwice the cfm that itexhausts into the shelterfrom oneofits ends. See\nFig. 1.that shows the pumpattached with \u0022C\u0022clampsto a small steel\ntable and being used to pump air into the 256 cubic foot suspended\nbag.\nI measured the pressure differences against which the pump was\noperated. In a shelter these differences typically are caused by the\nresistance toairflow in pipes, valves, and a filter. I measured pressure\ndifferences in inches water gauge (l in. w.g. = 0.036 psi) with the\nsmall-tube manometer attached to the side of the pump. To produce\nvarious pressure differences for several tests, I nailed a piece of\nplywood over the top of the air-intake duct, so as to produce different\nsized openings; in most tests I placed different layers of filter:\nmaterials in a filter box that was fitted airtight over-the 6 x 6-in.\nair-supplyductonthe top ofthe pump.

Findinga homemakeable method toseal the\nmoving piston so as to assure at least one month of continuous\nefficient pumping was the mostdifficult problem. Various rubber\nseals attached to the edges of the piston were unsatisfactory. and\naluminum sheetmetal strips (shaped and attached like the gal-\nvanized steel sheetmetal strips used in this model) wore out in less\nthan a week. even when oiled every 24 hours.\nTo save money during weeks of continuous durability testing,\nthe pump was operated by an electric motor that powered a pulley\ndrive that turned a 2-foot-diameter pulley having an attached\n40-in.-Iongsteel pitman with a hinged connection to a horizontally-\nsliding bar connected to the handle of the pump\u0027s wooden piston\nrod.

This worst-spot wear of 0.001 in. is only about a 6%\nreduction in thickness. The flap valves functioned as well as when\nnew. and appeared unworn.\nI conclude that this pump would be serviceable after several\nmonths of continuous use-provided it is lubricated after every 24\nhours of actual use. as in this durability test.

To attach the bottom, first place it (with its finished side down)\non the exposed long-edgesofthesides. Ifyou find thatthe bottom rests\non the construction forms and is not in contact with the long-edges of\nthe sides, in effect increase the heights of the sides by coating with\nadhesive both the edges of the sides and the 3/4-in.-wide area of the\nbottom to which the sides will be adhered. Then adhere the bottom\nonto the edges of the sides.

On each of the two strips marked \u0022T or B\u0022, draw an ink line\nalong which to make the approximately 30degree bend, and another\nline for the approximately90degree bend. (See the left halfof Fig. 13\nfor the distances from the edges of these two \u0022T or B\u0022strips to their\nbends.)

Check tosee thatthe four sheetmetal stripson the four sidesofthe\npiston all makeeven contactwith the wallsofthe\u0022cylinder\u0022when the\npiston is moved back and forth. If the piston does not slide back and\nforth quite easily even when not lubricated, carefully bend a strip or\nstrips so that they press less against the \u0022cylinder\u0022 walls. If while\nsomeone is shining a flashlight through a valve opening in the other\nend of the pump you observe that parts of a sheetmetal strip do not\nmake close contact with a \u0022cylinder\u0022 wall, gently bend outward that\npart of the strip.\n2. Lubricate all four walls of the \u0022cylinder\u0022, the sheetmetal strips\nthat slide against the walls, and the piston rod. Use a very thin\nmotor-breakin white lithium grease(not an ordinary bearing grease,\nthat is too sticky). Or use a thin oil. The pump should be lubricated\nafter no more than each 24 hours of use, and before being used again\nafter days of disuse. .\n3. Install the pump at a height above the floor so that most of the\npersons who are going to pump can push and pull with their hands\nmoving at about the same height that their elbows are when they are\nstanding. See Fig. 3for an exampleofa pump-supportingtable raised\nto an efficient heightfor operators who are the height of the pumper\npictured. .\n4. Tosave work and to minimize wearon the pump, usually operate\nit with a length ofstroke a little shorter than the distance between its\ntwo rubber bumpers. To save energy especially when pumping air\nthrough a high resistance ventilation system, move the piston back\nand forth by using mostly your leg and body muscles.\nPROLONGED STORAGE\nWipe offall greaseand other lubricants ifyoudo not plan to use this\npump for months. All lubricants-especially those on wood-tend to\nbecome gummy with time.\nKeep your supply of pump lubricants taped to your pump.\nREQUEST\nSuggestions for improving this pump and/or these instructions will\nbe appreciated, and may contribute to improvements likely to save\nlives.\nCresson H.

Even for an\ninfant or an infirm person remaining in a crowded shelter for days, 3\ncubic feet per minute(3cfm) isadequate. Fora healthy adultor child\n1.5cfm is enough. Too much carbon dioxide, not too little oxygen, is\nthe initial causeofunendurableconditions in inadequatelyventilated\nshelters in which the air does not get unendurably hot.\nIn contrast, up to 25cfrn ofoutdoorair per occupant may be needed\nto maintain endurable heat-humidity conditions inside a crowded\nshelter occupied for days during a heat wave in a hot, humid part of\nthe U.S. Hence the need for a large-volume ventilating pump, best\nwith a low-resistance filter.\nIfoutdoorairflows into ashelterthrough-a hood,gooseneck pipe, or\nother air-supply opening that causes all but tiny fallout particles to\nfall out before the air reaches shelter occupants, breathing this\nunfiltered air will not result in short-term radiation casualties.\nHowever, a very small fraction ofthe occupants ofa shelter supplied\nwith unfiltered air in an area of heavy fallout may contract cancer\nyears later as a resultof breathing shelter air containing tiny fallout\nparticles, that a properly designed filter could have removed.\nAir that has been in contact with fallout particles before being\nfiltered is not radioactive.\nThe homemade filter illustrated below, if used with an efficient\n\u0022suction\u0022 pump such as the Plywood Double-Action Piston Pump\ndescribed separately, will remove practically all fallout particles\nlikely to cause casualties even decades later. This filter also will\nremove most infective aerosols, the air-borne tiny particles used in\nbiological warfare - an unlikely type ofattack on the United States.\nIt will not remove poisonous gasses, an even less likely danger to\nAmericans if all-out war befalls us.\nCONSTRUCTION\nFilter Box\nIf20 x 20-inch furnace filters are available, use plywood or boards\nto build the filter box shown in the illustration. To make permanent\nconnections airtight, first use waterproof construction adhesive or\nglue, and then tape. (If only smaller filters are available, reduce the\nhorizontal dimensions of the box accordingly, except for the top and\nbottom openings.) Check to be sure that your filters will fit snugly in\nthe box of the size you plan to build.\nThe square frame on the bottom of the filter box should fit snugly\nover the square air-intake duct on the top of your Plywood Double-\nAction Piston Pump. Tape the cracksto makethe connection airtight\nand to permit easy removal of the filter box.\nMake the illustrated 4 supports of the hardware cloth no thicker\nthan 3/4 inch, thus providing enough space\u0027below the filter for low-\nresistance airflow. (Hardware cloth is a stiff, square-mesh, molten-\ndipped galvani-zed wire.)\nMake the square top of the filter box so that it covers the upper\nedges of the box\u0027s sides and can be easily removed. Then cut in its\ncentera round holeslightlysmallerthan 4inches indiameter. File the\nhole\u0027sedgessothata4-inch-diametercan (such as acoffeecan with its\ntop and bottom cut out) fits snugly in this hole. To connect the can\nsecurely and airtight, first use waterproof construction adhesive or\nepoxy, and then tape.

Filters that are sold in box-like housings can easily be\ninstalled sothatall the pumped air will passthrough them. by taping\nthem to the inner sides of the filter box. The illustration shows two\nplain matsof furnace filter material. each taped around its edges. (If\ncommercial dust filters are not available, bath towel cloth will serve.\nHowever, in very dusty areas a cloth filter may become overloaded,\nthus seriously reducing the rate of airflow much sooner than if an\noiled fiber filter is used as a prefilter.)\nTo filter out most of the tiny particles that may pass through one or\nmore furnace filters, place two thicknesses of bath towel on top of the\nfilter-support made of hardware cloth, and tape them around their\nedges to the box. See illustration.\nTests by U.S. Army specialists have shown that filtering air\nthrough two thicknesses of bath towel removes about 85 percent of\neven microscopic aerosols as small as 1to 5 microns in diameter. (See\n\u0022Emergency Respiratory Protection Against Radiological and Bio-\nlogical Aerosols\u0022, by H. G. Guyton et al., A.M.A. Archives of\nIndustrial Health, Vol. 20,July through Dec. 1959.)This is the size of\nmost infective aerosols used in biological warfare. In most of an area\nsubjected to a biological attack, if 85 percent of this size-range of\ninfective aerosols and practically all larger particles are removed,\nthen most persons breathing this filtered air will not receive enough\ninfective agents to infect and sicken them.\nPersons who are especially desirous of protecting their shelter\u0027s\noccupantsagainst biological warfare aerosols, butwho can not afford\nor obtain expensive High Efficiency Particulate Air filters (HEPA\nfilters), should consider using disposable pleated air filters that meet\nofficial ASHRAE standards. One 2-in. pleated air filter, measuring\n19-1/2 x 19-1/2 in., will remove over 90 percent of particles in the\n1.0-5.0micron range, yetwhen clean its resistance toan airflowof200\ncfm isonly about 0.2 in. watergauge(about0.007 psi). Its cost isabout\ntwice thatofagood ordinary furnace filterofthesamesize. However,\nit has approximatelythree times the lifeofa standard panel type filter\nbefore becoming overloaded. Disposable pleated air filters are avail-\nable in larger cities.\nUSE\nThe illustrated homemade filter has such low resistance to airflow\nthat, when up to about 200 cfm is being pumped through it by a\nPlywood Double-Action Piston Pump, the air volume is decreased by\nonly about 10 percent, as compared to the volume pumped with no\nfilter in the ventilation system. With a homemade Plywood Double-\nAction Piston Pump, up to approximately 200 cfm can be pumped\nthrough this filter even when the total difference in air pressure\n(caused by the ventilation pipes, a dirty filter, etc. that restrict\nairflow) is high, about 5 inches water gauge (0.18 psi).\nEven if the United States suffers an all-out Soviet attack, only a\nsmall partof its area will besubjected to blasteffectssevereenough to\ninjure the occupants of fallout shelters. (Fallout shelters are not\ndesigned to withstand blast, butespeciallytypicalearth-coveredones\nafford consequential blast protection.) In contrast, an installed filter,\nunless protected by an efficient blastvalve, will be wrecked by aquite\nlow-pressure blast wave that comes down its open air-intake pipe\n-even if the small partof the blast wave that would enter the shelter\nroom through its open ventilation pipes is not nearly powerful enough\ntoinjuretheshelteroccupants. Thus unprotected installed filters will\nbe wrecked in an area several times as large as the area in which\noccupants of fallout shelters will be injured by blast.\nTo be sure of having a filter in good condition, you can:\n1. Make and keep in your shelter an extra complete filter, ready to\nreplace your installed filter if it is damaged, or if it becomes\noverloaded with dust and its resistance to airflow becomes too high.\nFurthermore, if your filter is installed in your shelter room and\nbecomes so radioactive with retained fallout particles that it is\ndelivering a consequential radiation dose to shelter occupants, it is\nadvantageous to be able to remove it, pitch it out, \u0027and install a\nreplacement filter. (To be able to supply your shelter with unfiltered\nair in peacetime or after the end of consequential fallout danger, you\nshould make and keep ready a duct with appropriate fittings to\nconnect your pump directly to its air-intake pipe.)\n2. Ifyou have only one filter, do not install it beforeyou need tofilter\nthe air supply. Connect your pump directly to the air-intake pipe,\nusing an appropriate duct and fittings. Then before the attack and\nbefore the arrival of fallout (revealed by your fallout-monitoring\ninstrument), keep your shelter well ventilated with unfiltered air.\nWhetheror not yourfilter is installed, stop ventilatingyourshelterfor\na few hours while heavy fallout is being deposited outside - unless\nheat-humidityconditionsbecome unbearable. Ifbeforeshelterventila-\ntion is stopped the shelter air does not contain an abnormally high\nconcentration of carbon dioxide, then nooutdoor air need be supplied\nfor about 5 hours to prevent building up too high a concentration of\nrespiratory carbon dioxide - provided there is about 70cubic feet of\nshelter-room volume for each occupant.\nAN ENCOURAGING REMINDER\nPersons making preparations to improve their chances ofsurviving\nan all-out attack should realize that if the United States is hit with\nwarheads the sizes ofthose in the 1987 Sovietintercontinental arsenal,\nthe fallout particles of critical concern will be much larger than the\nextremely small particles (l to 5 microns in diameter) which are not\ncompletely removed\u0027bythisfilter. Falloutparticlesthissmall produced\nby large nuclear explosions do not fall to the ground for many days to\nmonths after the nuclear explosions, by which time they have become\nmuch less radioactive.

Chester, Health Physics, Sep-\ntember 1981.)\nA permanentfamily sheltercan serve quite\nwell for months as a post-attack temporary\nhome if it is designed to provide adequate\nnatural ventilation most of the time, to have\nadequate and easy forced ventilation by a KAP\nwhen forced ventilation is needed, and to have\ndaylight illumination. A shelter dependent on\nventilation laboriously pumped through pipes\nand on artificial lights even during daytime is\nmuch less practical for use as a post-attack\nhome.\nThe following instructions should enable a\nfamily having an earth-covered shelter with an\nemergency exit to make it much more livable\nfor months-long occupancy. The means de-\nscribed below for providing improved ventila-\ntion and daylight illumination also will supply\nguidance to survivors who will build shelters\npost-attack to minimize continuing radiation\nexposures, especially to children and pregnant\nwomen.\nBUILDING AND USING A MULTI-PURPOSE\nEMERGENCY EXIT HOUSING\nBuild a multi-use emergency exit housing\nof the design pictured in Fig. F.l and detailed in\nFig. F.2. Size your exit housing to fit snugly\nover the top of your completed vertical exit\nshaft. This exit housing is made of 3/4-inch\nexterior plywood, four 2 x 2 x 36-inch boards,\nand four 16 x 16-inch window panes of 1/8-inch\nPlexiglas. Plated screws and waterproof ad-\nhesives are used to assure sturdiness and\ndurability.\nFig.F.1. Multi-UseEmergencyExitHousing\nInstalled Over the Square Emergency Exit\nDescribed by Figs. 17.1, 17.2, and 17.3.\nThe adjustable top of this exit housing\nmeasures 4x 4 x 1feet, andcan be tiltedto make\ndifferent sized ventilation openings in any of\nfour directions. The top also can be raised\nstraight up to make various sized openings all\nthe wayaround, oritQan becompletelyclosed -\nas explained by Fig. F.2 and the following\ndescriptions of its uses.","metadata":{"completeSentences":"false"}},{"number":308,"content":"11\ni\n48\u0022\nFig. F.3.
