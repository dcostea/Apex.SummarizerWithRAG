 thearrivaloffallout, when
the dose rates and doses receivedare highest, shelter occupants should use their
fallout meters todetermine whereto placethemselvesto minimizethe dosesthey
receive.
They should useavailable tools and materials to reduce the doses they receive,
.especially during the first day, by digging deeper (if practical) and reducing the
size of openings by partially blocking them with earth, water containers, etc.
- while maintaining adequate ventilation. To greatly reduce the slight risk of
fallout particles entering the body through nose or mouth, shelter occupants
should cover nose and mouth with a towel or other cloth while the fallout is
being deposited outside their shelter, ifat the same time ventilating air isbeing
blown or pumped through their shelter.
The air inside an occupied shelter often becomes very humid. Ifa good flow of
outdoorair isflowing into a shelter - especiallyifpumped bybrieflyoperatinga
KAP or otherventilating pump- a KFM usuallycan becharged at theair intake
ofthe shelter room without puttingitinsidea dry-bucket. However, ifthe air to
which a KFM is exposed has a relative humidity of 90% or higher, the
instrument cannot be charged, even by quickly unrolling a roll of tape.
Inextensive areas of heavyfallout, the occupants ofmost home basements,that
provide inadequateshieldingagainstheavyfallout radiation, would beindeadly
danger. Byusingadependablefallout meter, occupantswould find that persons
lyingon the floor incertainlocationswould receivethe smallestdoses, and that,
ifthey improvise additionalshieldinginthese locations, thedoses receivedcould
begreatly reduced. Additionalshieldingcan beprovided bymakinga verysmall
shelter insidethe basementwhere the dose rate isfound to belowest. Furniture,
boxes, etc.can beusedfor walls,doorsfor the roof, and watercontainers,books,
and other heavy objects for shielding - especially on the roof. Or, if tools are
available, breaking through the basement floor and digginga shelter trench will
greatly increase available protection against radiation. If a second expedient
ventilatingpump, a KAP, (ora smallDirectionalFan), ismadeand usedasa
fan, such an extremely cramped shelter inside a shelter usually can be occupied
by several times as many persons as can occupy it without forced
ventilation.
