.
19. Dig small drainage ditches around the completed
shelter, to lead runoff water away.
20. To keep rain and; or sand-like fallout particles
from falling into the shelter openings, build an
open-sided canopy over each opening, as
illustrated in Fig. A, shown in the introductory
sectio.n of Appendix A.
21. Install the air pump (a KAP) in the shelter
opening into which air is already naturally
moving.
22. If the shelter has a KAP, protection against
radiation can be increased by placing containers
of water and ofheavy foods, or bags of earth, so
as to partially block the openings. This would
still permit adequate air to be pumped through
the shelter, except in very hot weather.
23. For seats, place water and food containers,
bedding, etc., along the side of the trench that is
farther from the off-center entry trenches. If the
trench floor is damp, covering it with a
waterproof material, tree limbs, or brush will
help.
24. Fill all available water containers, including pits
which have been dug and lined with plastic, then
roofed with available materials. If possible,
disinfect all waterstored in expedient containers,
using one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,
such as Clorox, for each 10 gallons of water.
Even if only muddy water isavailable, store it. Ifyou do not have a disinfectant, it may be possible
to boil water when needed.
25. Put at least your most useful emergency
tools inside your shelter.
26. Astime and materials permit, continueto improve
your chances of surviving by doing as many of the
following things as possible:
(I) Makea homemade fallout meter, asdescribed
in Appendix C, and expedient lights.
(Prudent people will have made these
extremely useful items well ahead of
time.)
(2) Install screens or mosquito netting over the
two openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a
problem. Remember, however, that screen or
netting reduces the air flow through a shelter
- even when the airispumped through with a
KAP.
(3) Dig a stand-up hole near the far end of the
shelter. Make the hole about 15in. indiameter
and deep enough to permit the tallest of the
shelter occupants to stand erect occasionally.

Fig. A.1. Door-Covered Trench Shelter.Appendix A.2
Pole-Covered Trench Shelter
PROTECTION PROVIDED
Against fallout radiation: Protection Factor300
(PF 300)-a person in the open outside this shelter
would receive 300.times more fallout radiation than
he would if he were inside.
Against blast: Quite good protection if built in
stable earth. Blast tests have indicated that this
shelter, if built in stable earth, would not be seriously
damaged by blast effects of large explosions at least
up to the 7-psi overpressure range. (At 7 psi, most
buildings would be demolished.) Without blast
doors, occupants of the shelter could be injured,
although probably not fatally at this overpressure.
Against fire: Excellent, if sufficiently distant
from fires producing carbon monoxide and toxic
smoke.
WHERE PRACTICAL
In wooded areas with small trees, for builders
who have an ax or a bow saw, crosscut or chain saw,
and digging tools.
