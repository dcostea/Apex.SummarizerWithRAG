To pump a large KAP most effectively with a
push-pole, stand with your back to the KAP and
grasp the push-pole with both hands. Using mostly
your leg muscles, push the KAP by pulling the free
end of its push-pole toward you.Figure 26shows an improvised, flexible connec-
tion of a push-pole attached to the center brace of a
large KAP 28 in. from the top of its frame.

E. Ventilating a Shelter with
Only One Opening
Some basement rooms that may be used as
shelters have only one opening, the doorway. A KAP
can be used to ventilate sucha shelter room ifenough
well-mixed and distributed air is movingjust outside
the doorway, or if air from outdoors can be pumped
in by another KAP and made to flow in a hallway or
room and pass just outside this doorway. Figure 27
indicates how to ventilate such a one-opening room
by operating a 3-ft KAP as an air-intake pump inthe
upper part of the doorway.
Below such a doorway KAP, a "divider" 6 ft to
8 ft long can be installed. The divider permitsexhaust
air to flow out of the room without much of it being
"sucked" back into the room by the KAP swinging
above it. Plywood, reinforced heavy cardboard, or
even well-braced plastic can be used to make a
divider. It should be installed so that, in a possible
emergency, it can be jerked out of the way in a few
seconds.
When used with a divider, a 36X29in. KAP can
pump almost 1000 cubic feet' of air per minute into
and out of such a shelter room. Although 1000cubic
feet of well-distributed air is sufficient for several
times as many as 25 shelter occupants under most
temperate climate conditions, it is enough for only
about 25 people in a one-entry room under
exceptionally severe heat-wave conditions. Further-
more, to make it habitable for even 25 people under
such conditions, the air in this room must be kept
from rising more than 2Â°F above the temperature
outdoors. This can be done using a second air-supply
KAP to pump enough outdoor air through the
building and in some cases also using air-distribution
KAPs in spaces outside the one-entry room. The
KAP in the doorway of a one-entry room should
supply 40 cfm per occupant of this room.
In order to prevent any of the used, warmed,
exhaust air from the one-entry room from being
"sucked"by the doorway KAP back into the room, a
stiffened rectangular duct can be builtsoas to extend
the exhaust-opening (in the lower part of the
doorway) several feet outside the room. Such a duct
can be built of plastic supported by a frame of small
boards. It can be used to discharge the exhaustair far
enough away from the KAP and "downstream"inthe
airflow outside the one-opening room so that no
exhausted air can be "sucked" back into the room.ORNL DWG 72-8203
