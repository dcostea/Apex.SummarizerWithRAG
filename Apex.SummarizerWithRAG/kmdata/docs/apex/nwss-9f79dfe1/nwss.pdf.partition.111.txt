DESCRIPTION
Each iOSArM Tablet contains 130 mg. of potassium
iodide.
HOW POTASSIUM IODIDE WORKS
Certain forms of iodine help your thyroid gland work
right. Most people get the iodine they need from foods
like iodized salt or fish. The thyroid can "store" or hold
only a certain amount of iodine.
In a radiation emergency, radioactive iodine may be
released in the air. This material may be breathed or
swallowed. It may enter the thyroid gland and damage it.
The damage would probably not show itself for years.
Children are most likely to have thyroid damage.
If you take potassium iodide, it will fill up your thyroid
gland. This reduces the chance that harmful radioactive
iodine will enter the thyroid gland.
WHO SHOULD NOT TAKE POTASSIUM IODIDE
The only people who should not take potassium iodide
are people who know they are allergic to iodide. You may
take potassium iodide even if you are taking medicines
for a thyroid problem (for example, a thyroid hormone or
antithyroid drug). Pregnant and nursing women and
babies and children may also take this drug.
HOW AND WHEN TO TAKE POTASSIUMIODIDE
Potassium iodide should be taken as soon as possible
after public health officials tell you. You should take one
dose every 24 hours. More will not help you because the
thyroid can "hold" only limited amounts of iodine. Larger
doseswill increasethe risk of side effects. You will proba-
bly be told not to take the drug for more than 10days.SIDE EFFECTS
Usually, side effects of potassium iodide happen when
people take higher doses for a long time. Youshould be
careful not to take more than the recommended dose or
take it for longer than you are told. Side effects are
unlikely because of the low dose and the short time you
will be taking the drug.
Possible side effects include skin rashes, swelling of the
salivary glands, and "iodism" (metallic taste, burning
mouth and throat, sore teeth and gums, symptoms of a
head cold. and sometimes stomach upset and diarrhea).
