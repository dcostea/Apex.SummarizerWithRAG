Fig. 11.TEMPLATE for Positioning the Stop-Strings of each of the 12valve holes, and for attaching each of the 6 valve flaps.
TRACE THIS DRAWING. TO MAKE THE WORKING
TEMPLATE, TRANSFER THE TRACING TO A PIECE OF
CARDBOARD. CUT OUT THE 2 X 4-INCH HOLE IN THE
CARDBOARD, AND MAKE SMALL HOLES SHOWING
THE POSITIONS OF THE STOP-STRINGS AND TACKS.Fig. 14. Plywood Piston with Sheetmetal Sealing Strips Attached.

h. Bend the other "T or B" strip, and similarly bend each of the
two "S" strips.
4. Attach the four sheetmetal sealing strips to the plywood piston
with No.6 tacks(l/2-in. long). Place on a solid metal surfacethe part
ofthe plywood piston oppositethe spot to which partofastripisbeing
tacked, sothat when a tack ishammered in its pointisclinched(bent
over) on the far side of the 3/8-ln.-thick plywood piston, by being
hammered against the solid metal surface.
a. First tack a "T or B" sheetmetal strip to the top of the piston,
and a "T or B"strip to its bottom.
b. Then tack the two "S" strips to its sides. The strips should fit
togethersoas to makesquarecorners.Ifadjacentends oftwostripsdo
not fit neatly together, cut bit by bit a very little off the end(s) of a
strip(s) so that the two adjacent ends fit together neatly at their
corner.
c. To prevent air leakage between the ends of the sealing strips,
put rubber cement in the four corner "cracks" between strips. (This
was not done on the test pump's piston.)
Fig. 13. Piston Sealing Strips, each made of a springy sheetmetal
strip 3 in. wide.
g. With the sheetmetal strip held sandwiched between the two
12-1/4-in.-long boards by the two "C" clamps and the vise, so that the
bending line for the almost 90-degree bend is barely visible, bend the
exposed part of the strip 90 degrees, in the same direction that the
3[8-in.-wide part was bent. See Figs. 13and 14.

MAKING THE PISTON, THE PISTON ROD, AND ITS
HANDLE
1. Have a sheetmetal shop cut three 3-ft-long, 3-in.-wide strips of
galvanized steel sheetmetal that is no more than O.016-in.thick and
nolessthan 0.012-in.thick. (Mostgalvanized steel valley flashing used
by roofers and sold by many lumber yards is less than 0.016-in.
