 from run-
ning under the carand intothe trench, the upper
edges of 5-foot-wide strips of polyethylene film
first were attached with duct tape to the sides
and ends of the car, about 2 feet above the
ground. Then earth was piled onto the parts of
the film strips that were lying on the ground, to
secure them. Finally, earth was piled against
the vertical parts of the attached film strips.

sides of an earth-loaded car provides better,
more secure side shielding, but requires more
materials and work.)
INHALATION DANGERS
Only extremely small fallout particles can
reach the lungs. The human nose and other air
passages" ... can filter out almost all particles
10 micrometers [10 microns] [or larger] in dia-
meter, and about 95 percentofthoseexceeding5
micrometers." (See reference 6, page 599.) Five
micrometers equal 5 millionths of a meter, or 5
thousandths of a millimeter.
Using a dust mask or breathing through
cloth would be helpful to keep from inhaling
larger "hot" fallout particles which may cause
beta burns in noses, sinuses, and bronchial
tubes. Many such retained particles may be
swallowedwhenclearedfrom one's airpassage-
ways by the body'snatural protectiveprocesses.
As shown below in Fig. 6.4, a relatively
"large" particle - 40 microns (40 um) in dia-
meter, spherical, and with the sand-likedensity
of most fallout particles - falls about 1300 feet
in 8 hours. (A dark-colored particle 40 microns
in diameter is about as small a speck as most
people can see with the naked eye.) Most 40-
J1. m-diameter fallout particles would take a55

Fig. 6.4. Stabilized Radioactive Fallout Clouds Shown a Few Minutes After the Explosions, with
distances that spherical fallout particles having diameters of 40,50, and 100 microns fall in 8 hours.e
few days to fall from the cloud ofa one-megaton
explosion down far enough into the troposphere
to be occasionally scavenged and promptly
broughtto earth by rain or snow while still very
radioactive. In 1987, however, most of the thou-
sands of deployed Soviet ICBM warheads are
550 kilotons or smaller. (See Jane's Weapon SI'S-
[ems. /987-88.) The stabilized clouds of such
explosions would be mostly in the troposphere,
and some of even the tiniest particles - those
small enough to be breathed into one's lungs -
would be promptly scavenged and deposited in
scattered "hot spots." Fortunately, most of the
very small and tiniest fallout particles would
not be deposited for days to months, by which
time radioactive decay would have made them
much lessdangerous. Breathingtiny radioactive
particles into one's lungs would constitute a
minor health hazard compared to otherdangers
that would afflict an unprepared people sub-
jected to a large scale nuclear attack.
SCAVENGING OF RADIOACTIVE
PARTICLES
Scavenging is most effective below about
30,000 feet, the maximum height of most rain
and snow clouds. See Fig. 6.4.
