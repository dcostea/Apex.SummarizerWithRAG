 slightly lifting
the thread with a knife tip held under the center of the thread, slip the
finished leaf under the thread and into position exactly on the top of the
leaf outlined on the pattern page. Hold the leaf in this position with two
fingers.
Be sure you have read through step 18before you do anything else.
12. Cut an 8-1;'2inch piece of fine, unwaxed, very clean thread that has not been
anti-static treated. See INSTRUCTIONS, Page 6 for excellent insulating
threads and substitutes. In 1986 most sewing threads are anti-static treated
and are too poor insulators for use in a KFM.
14. While keeping the thread straight between its two taped-down ends,
lower the thread so that it sticks to the two plastic strips. Then press the
thread against the plastic strips.
15. With the point of the knife, hold down the center of the thread against
the center of the THREAD LINE of the leaf. Then, with two fingers,
carefully fold over the hem and press it almost flat. Be sure that the
thread comes out of the corners of the hem. Remove the knife, and press
the hem down completely flat against the rest of the leaf.
16. Make small marks on the thread at the two points shown on the pattern
page. Use a ballpoint pen if available.
17. Loosen the second two small pieces of tape from the pattern paper, but leave
these tapes stuck to the thread.COVER THE TWO "TAPE HERE" RECTANGLES WITH SAME-SIZED PIECES
OF TAPE, IN ORDER TO KEEP FROM TEARING THIS PAPER WHEN
REMOVING TWO ADDITIONAL PIECES OF TAPE. THEN, BY PUTTING
TWO OTHER PIECES OF TAPE THIS SAME SIZE ON TOP OF THE FIRST
TWO PIECES, TAPE THE THREAD ONTO THIS GUIDE SHEET, AND LATER
ATTACH A LEAF TO THE TAPED-DOWN THREAD. .

PATTERN (C)
(Cut out this guide along its border lines and tape to the top of a work table.)
WARNING: The parts of the thread that will be inside the can and on which the leaf will
be suspended must serve to insulate the high-voltage electrical charges to be placed on the leaf.
Therefore, the suspended parts of the thread must be kept very clean.

a..XII. Make the Plastic Cover
Cut out the paper pattern for the cover from the Pattern Page (8).
From a piece of clear, strong 'plastic, cut a circle approximately the same
size as the paper pattern. (Storm-window vinyl film. 4 mils thick. is best.)
Stretch the center of this circular piece of clear plastic over the open end of the
can. and pull it down close to the sides of the can. making small tucks in the
"skirt." so that there are no wrinkles in the top cover. Hold the lower part of
the "skirt" in place with a strong rubber band or piece of string. (If another
can having the same diameter as the KFM can is available, use it to make the
cover --to avoid the possibility of disturbing the leaf-suspending threads.)
