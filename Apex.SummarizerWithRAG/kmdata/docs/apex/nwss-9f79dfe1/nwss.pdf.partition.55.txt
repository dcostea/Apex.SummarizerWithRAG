 SHELTERS
A permanent family fallout shelter, built at
moderate cost before a crisis. should have a
ventilation system that can supply adequate
volumes of either filtered or unfiltered air.
pumped in through an air-intake pipe and out
through an air-exhaust pipe. Provision also
should be made for the grim possibility that
fallout could be so heavy that a shelter might
have to be occupied for weeks, orevenpart-time
for months. A smallormedium-sized permanent
shelter should be designed so that most of the
time after an attack itcan have adequate natural
ventilationthroughits entryway andemergency
exit. During hot spells, forced ventilation
through these same large air passageways
should be provided by using a homemade KAP.
This manual air pump, described in Appendix
B, can force large volumes of air through low-
resistance openings with minimum effort.
Ways to ventilate and cool permanent shel-
ters are described in Chapter 17, "Permanent
Family Fallout Shelters for Dual Use," and in
AppendixE, "Howto Makeand Use a Homemade
PlywoodDouble-ActionPistonPumpandFilter."

Thereaderis advisednotto readthis section

shelter described in an official civil defense
publication.
Because of the worldwide extreme fear of
radiation, civil defense specialists who prepare
official self-help instructions for building
shelters have made radiation protection their
overriding objective. Apparently the men in
Moscow and Washington who decide what
shelter-buildingandshelter-ventilatinginstruc-
tions their fellow citizens receive - especially
instructions for building and improving ex-
pedient shelters-do not understand the ven-
tilationrequirementsformaintainingendurable
temperature/humidity conditions in crowded
shelters. It must be remembered that shelters
may have to be occupied continuously for days
in warm or hot weather.
Russian small expedient shelters are even
more dangerously under-ventilated than are
most of their American counterparts, and can
serve to illustrate similar ventilation deficien-
ciesof American shelters. Figure6.5 is a Russian
drawing(with itscaptiontranslated)ofa "Wood-
EarthShelter" in a Sovietself-helpcivildefense
booklet, "Anti-Radiation Shelters in Rural
Areas." This booklet, published in a 200,000-
copy edition, includes illustrated instructions
for building 20 different types of expedient
shelters. All20ofthese sheltershavedangerous-
ly inadequate natural ventilation, and none of
them have air pumps. Note that this high-
protection-factor, covered-trench shelter de-
pends on air flowing down through its "Dust
FilterwithStrawPacking(hay)" andoutthrough
its small "Exhaust Duct with Damper."
As partofOak Ridge NationalLaboratory's
participation inDefenseNuclearAgency's "Dice
Throw" 1978 blasttest, I builttwoRussianPole-
Covered Trench Shelters. These were like the
shelter shown in Fig. 6.5, except that each
lacked a trapdoor and filter. As anticipated, so
little air flowed through these essentially dead-
ended test shelters that temperatures soon be-
came unbearable.Fig. 6.5. Figure 20. Wood-Earth Shelter without Lining of the Walls for Clay Soils, 10

Russian earth-covered expedient fallout
sheltersarebasedonmilitarydugoutsdesigned
for brief occupancy during a conventional at-
tack. Subsequently, they were improved for
falbut protection but were made much less
habitable by Soviet civil defense specialists.
Apparently these specialists were ignorant of
ventilation requirements, and almost certainly
they did not field-test small expedient fallout
shelters for habitability.
