a well like the Chinese water source shown on
page 71. If you are in a fallout area, before
drinking water from a water. pit you should
filter it through clayey soil to remove fallout
particles and dissolved radioactive isotopes, as
described in the Water chapter. Of course it is
prudent to chlorinate or boil all surface and
near-surface water after it has been filtered.
FOOD
• Advantages of a one-year supply: A family
that expends the money and work to build and
provision its own shelter should store a year's
supply oflong-lastingfoods. Ifpost-attackcon-
ditionsenableyouto continuelivingandmaking
a living near your home, having a year's food
supply will be a tremendous advantage. And if
your area is afflicted with such dangerous,
continuing fallout radiation and!or other post-
attack conditions that surviving unprepared
residents are soon forced to evacuate to better
areas, thenyourandyourfamily's chanceswill
be better if hunger does not force you to move
during the chaotic first few months after a
nuclear attack.
• Costs of a one yearfood supplyfor a family
shelter: Table 17.1 shows the wide range of 1987
costs of the basic survival foods for multi-year
storagethatarelisted andexplainedonpage88.
The delivered costs listed in the right hand
column include UPS shipping charges in the
nearest and least expensive of UPS's 8 zones.
For UPS shipping costs to the most distant
points in the 48 states, add 34 cents per pound
delivered.
All the foods in this survival ration, if
stored in moisture-proof and insect-proof con-
tainers (the non-fat milk powder should be in
nitrogen-packed cans), will provide healthful
nutrition for at least 10 years. The exception is
the multi-vitamin tablets, which should be re-
placed every 2 or3 years, depending on storage
temperature. Soa family thatspendsabout$300
per member on such a one year survival ration
can consider that each of its members has been
covered by famine insurance for $30 a year.
Scurvywill be thefirst incapacitating,then
lethal vitamin deficiency to afflict unprepared,
uninformed Americans. A multi-vitamin tablet
contains enough vitamin C to fully satisfy the
daily requirement. However, a prudent shelter
owner also should store vitamin C tablets, that
keep for years. One hundred 500-mg generic
vitamin C tablets - 50,000 mgof vitamin C - in
1987 typically cost about $1.20 in a discount
store; a 10mgdailydose prevents scurvy. After
a nuclear war in some areas vitamin C will be
worth many times its weight in gold.

*Wheat: If you live in a wheat producing
area, the least expensive sources of ready-to-
store wheat usually are local seed-cleaning
firms. A hundredpoundsormoreofhardwheat,
dried, bagged, and ready to store in moisture
proof containers, costs about 10 cents a pound.
(Today the wheat farmer receives about 4.5
cents a pound for truckloads, usually straight
outofthefield, notdryenoughto storeexceptin
well ventilated granaries, and containing trash
that makes weevil infestations more likely.) In
some communities a few stores sell big bagsof
dry, cleaned hard wheat for 20 to 35 cents a
pound.
