trated 5-person shelter, these are:

"This width equals the distance measured across the tops of a single layer of poles when a sufficient number of polesare laid on
the ground side by side with all/he same ends in a straight line and touching. (These poles will be placed butt-ends down to form
the walls of the shelter room.) .
hThis width equals the dist~nce measured across a single layer of poles when a sufficient number of poles are laid on the
ground side by side and touching, with large ends and small ends alternating so as 10 cover a rectangular area.
'To be cut into the various lengths needed to close the ends of the main,room and also to close a part of each entryway.
• A saw and an ax or hatchet, to cutgreen
poles, (A bow saw or crosscutsaw serves well
and often is more dependable than a chain
saw. Having an extra blade for a bow saw
may be essential.)
• Two shovels (one shovel for each two
workers is desirable). A pick will also be
needed, if the earth is hard.
• Large buckets, cans, or pots with bail
handles-in which to carry earth, and laterto
store water or wastes.
• A knife.
• A hammer and at least 80 nails (3 in. or
longer). If these are not at hand, rope, wire,
or strips of cloth can be used to lash poles
together. At least 200 ft. of rope or strong
wire will be needed, or two additional
bedsheets for each person to be sheltered.
(Other fabric of equal strength can be used.)
The cloth can be cut or. torn into foot-wide
strips and twisted slightly to make "rope."
• Three double-bed sheets for the illus-
trated 5-person shelter or a piece of strong
fabric or plastic of about the same size. One
additional sheet for each additional 2
occupants. (If sufficient sheets or other
material are not available, use many sticks
and small poles, placed across the 9-ft side
poles.)
• At least 2 square yards per person of
rainproofing material (shower curtains,
plastic tablecloths, plasticmattresscovers, or
the like)-essential in rainy, cold weather.
• Materials for building a ventilating
pump, a KAP 20 in. wide and 26 in. high.
(See Appendix B.)
• Containers for storing 15 gallons of
water per occupant. (See Chapter 8.)
B. Useful Tools and Materials
• Additional saws, axes, hatchets, shovels,
and large buckets or cans.
