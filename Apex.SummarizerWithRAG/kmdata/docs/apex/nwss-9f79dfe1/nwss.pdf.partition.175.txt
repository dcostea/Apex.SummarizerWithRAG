 moving naturally at the time. (If
shortof time ormaterials for a KAP, make a
small Directional Fan.)
28. Cover all exposed combustible material with
mud, earth, or otherfireproofmaterial, to reduce
the chance of exposed cloth being ignited from a
nuclear explosion or heat from a nearby fire.
29. Fill all available water containers, including pits
which have been dug and lined with plastic, then
roofed with available materials. If possible,
disinfect all water stored inexpedientcontainers,
using one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,
such as Clorox, for each IO gallons of water.
Even if only muddy water is available, store it. If
you do not have a disinfectant, it may be possible
to boil water when needed.
30. Put at least your most useful emergency
tools inside your shelter.
31. Astime and materials permit,continueto improve
your chances of surviving by doing as many of the
following things as possible:
(I) Make a homemadefallout meter,as described
in Appendix C, and expedient lights.
(Prudent people will have made these
extremely useful items well ahead of
time.)
(2) Instail screens or mosquito netting over the
two openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a
problem. Remember, however, that screen or
netting reduces the air flow through a shelter
- even when the air ispumped through with a
