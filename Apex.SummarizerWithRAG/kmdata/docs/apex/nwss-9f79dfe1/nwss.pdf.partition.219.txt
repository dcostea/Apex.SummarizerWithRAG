 fingers until they
appear to be a single thin, flat sheet.
6. Hold the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN on top of the 8-ply aluminum foil
sheet, with the pattern's THIRD-FOLDEDGE on top of the third-fold edge of
the 8-ply aluminum sheet. Be sure that one lower comer of the
FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN is on top of the exacdy square comer of the
8-ply aluminum sheet.
.If only heavy duty aluminum foil (sometimes called "extra heavy duty") is
available, make S-plyleaves of the same size, and use the table for the 8-ply KFM
to determine radiation dose rates. To make a S-ply leaf, start by cutting out a
piece of foil approximately 4 inches by 4 inches. Fold it to make a 4-ply sheet
approximately 2 inches by 2 inches, with one corner exactly square. Next from a
single thickness of foil cut a square approximately 2 inches by 2 inches. Slip this
square into a 4-ply sheet, thus making a S-ply sheet. Then make the S-ply leaf,
using the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, etc. as described for making an 8-ply leaf.
