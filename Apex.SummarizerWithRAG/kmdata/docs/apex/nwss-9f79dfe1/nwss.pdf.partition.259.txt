FUNCTIONAL RELATIONS OF PARTS
Look at Figs. 2, 5, and 6. In Figs. 5 and 6, the lower, fixed partof
the front end is pictured below the piston rod. The piston rod slides
back and forth on-the center of the fixed part of the front end (as
indicated moreclearly in Fig. 7).and in the notch in the removable
part of the front end.
Fig. 5. Front End of the Durability Test Pump, showing the lower
fixed part (below piston rod) and the upper removable
part, that is held by 6 screws with flat washers. Felt
weather-stripping makes the removable part airtight.Fiz. 6. Pump Built by Dale Huber, of Lake City, Florida in his home
workshop, while guided only by the second draft of these
repeatedly improved instructions. The removable part of the
front end has been taken off, to insert the piston into the 12x
12-in."cylinder" under the PARTITION. The plastic flaps of
this pump's flap valves are black: transparent plastic film is
preferred.

Fig. 8. Back End. Only the plywood is shown.
Note that a single plastic-film
flap covers each pair of 2 x 4-in.
valve holes, and that. as shown in
Fig. 2Ithatgivesaside viewofall
six flaps), all flaps open away
from the vertical center-plane of
the pump.
In Fig. 5the removable(upper)
part of the front end is shown in
place, secured bysix round-head
screws with flat washers. In Fig.
7 note the pair of 2 x 4-in. flap-
valve holes above the piston rod.
In Fig. 6.the removable partof
the front end has been removed,
exposing the 26-;n.-long, hori-
zontal PARTITION that serves
as the top of the 12 x 12-in.
"cylinder", in which the piston
can make a 24-in.-maximum-
length stroke. Also see Figs. 2
and 7. Fig. 6alsoshows the piston
while it isbeingremoved and one
ofthe two rubber bumpers(made
ofinner tube rubber)onits piston
rod.
The back end of the "box" is
made of one piece of plywood. as
shown in Fig. 8. The two plastic
flaps of its exhaust valves each
cover two 2 x 4-in. valve holes,
that are positioned the same as
the four valve holes in the front
end.
