Fig. A.A. Aboveground, Door-Covered Shelter.Appendix A.5
Aboveground, Ridgepole Shelter
PROTECTION PROVIDED
Against fallout radiation: Protection Factor300
(PF 300) if covered with 24 in. of earth. (A person in
the open outside this shelter would receive about 300
times more fallout radiation than if he were inside.)
See the accompanying drawing at the end of
Appendix A.5.
Against blast: Better protection than most
homes. Blast tests have indicated that this shelter
would be undamaged at least ul? to the S-Qsi
overpressure range from large explosions. Without
blast doors, the shelter's occupants could be injured
at this overpressure range, although probably not
fatally.
Against fire: Good, if the shelter is sufficiently
distant from fires producing carbon monoxide and
toxic smoke.
WHERE PRACTICAL
In many wooded areas and wherever enough
poles are available.
In locations where belowgrourid expedient
shelters are impractical because the water table or
rock is too close to the surface for a covered-trench
shelter.
FOR WHOM PRACTICAL
For a family or other group with five or
more members able to work hard for most of48
hours, with at leastone member able to saw and
fit poles and use the hand tools listed on the
following page. (A group of rural Florida fami-
lies. with 12 of the 15 members able to work,
completed a shelter like this 23 hours and 40
minutes after receiving the step-by-step, well
illustratedinstructions 12milesfromthe wooded
building site. They used only muscle-powered
tools, and movedover50 tonsofsandy shielding
earth.)
CAPACITY
The shelter illustrated in Fig. A.5 is the
minimum length for 5 persons. For each additional
person, add I ft to the length of the ridgepole and
shelter room. (If more than about 15persons are to be
~\\~\\~\~~,\it~2. \)\ \l\\)\'C ~'C't>'d"t'd\~ Th~\m,)
BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS
I. Before beginning work, study Fig. A.5 and read
ALL of the following instructions.
2. Divide the work. CHECK OFF EACH STEP
WHEN COMPLETED.
3. By the time the shelter is finished, plan to have
completed a ventilating pump (a KAP 20in. wide
and 26 in high, essential for this shelter except in
cool weather) and the storage of at least 15
gallons of water per occupant. (See Appendix B
and Chapter 8.)
4. Start to assemble the materials. For the illus-
trated 5-person shelter, these are:
A. Essential Materials and Tools
• Poles. (Fresh-cut, green poles are best;
sound, untreated poles are satisfactory.
