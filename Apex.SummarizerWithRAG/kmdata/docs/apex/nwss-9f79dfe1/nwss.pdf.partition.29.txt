The air bursting of one of the probably few
20-megaton warheads carried by Soviet ICBMs
would destroy typical American homes up to
about 16milesfrom groundzero. Incontrast, the
air bursting of an approximately t-megaton
warhead - one ofthe large warheads in today's
Soviet arsenal - would destroy most homes
within a roughly circular area having a radius
of "only" about 5 miles. So, if you take into
consideration the advantages to Soviets of
arming their largest ICBMs with several very
accurate smaller warheads, each capable of
destroying a militarily important target, you
may logically conclude that unless your home
is closerthan 10miles from the nearestprobable
target, you need not evacuate to avoid blast and
fire dangers.
Your planning to avoid incapacitating or
fatal exposure to fallout radiation will involve
more uncertaintiesthan will yourplansto avoid
blast and fire dangers. The high altitude winds
that carry fallout farthest before deposition
usually blow from west to east. Therefore, in
most areas your chances of avoiding extreme-
ly dangerous radiation dangers are improved if28

you evacuate westward to an area away from
likely nearby targets. However, since no one
can foretell with certainty in what directions
future winds will blow, your plans to remain
where you live, or your crisis evacuation plans
should include building, improving, orutilizing
high-protection-factor shelter, as explained in
following chapters.
If you live near a target the destruction of
which has high priority in Soviet war-winning
strategy, then a decade or so ago it quite likely
was targetted by a 20-MT warhead. Fig. 4.1
shows the awesome size ofthe stabilized radio-
active cloud from a 20-MT air burst. This cloud
wouldexpand in minutes to this huge size in the
thin air of the stratosphere, would contain only
extremely small particles almost all of which
would remain airborne for weeks to years, and
would result in no fallout deposition that would
promptly incapacitate exposed people.
A 20-MT surfaceburst ornear-surface burst
would produce a stabilized radioactive cloud
extending almost as far in all directions from
GZ as would a 20-MT air burst. Its tremendous
fireball would "suck up" millions of tons of
pulverized rock and would contaminate those
particles with its radioactive material. Fallout
particles as big as marbles" would fall from the
stabilized cloud to the ground in minutes. Very
heavy fallout could be deposited as far as 18
miles upwind from such a 20-MT explosion,
with heavyfallout, capable ofcausingfatalities
within days to weeks, extending downwind for
several hundred miles.
A l-MTsurfaceburst,Fig. 4.1,wouldproduce
a stabilized fallout cloud unlikely to result in
fallout being deposited in the upwind or cross-
wind directions from GZ beyondthe rangeofthe
explosion's home-destroying blast effects.
