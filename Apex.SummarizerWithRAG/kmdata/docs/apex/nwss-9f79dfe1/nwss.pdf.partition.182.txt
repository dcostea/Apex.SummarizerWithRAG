essentials.
37. To prevent fallout or rain from falling onto the
floor of the outer entryways, place a small
awning (not illustrated) over each opening.
38. Fill all available water containers, including pits
which have been dug and lined with plastic, then
roofed with available materials. If possible,
disinfect all waterstored inexpedient containers,
using one scant teaspoon of a chlorine bleach,
such as Clorox, for each 10 gallons of water.
Even if only muddy water isavailable, store it. If
you do not have a disinfectant, itmay be possible
to boil water when needed.
39. Put all of your emergency tools inside your
shelter.
40. Astime and materials permit, continueto improve
your chances of surviving by doing as many of the
following things as possible:
(I) Make a homemadefallout meter, as described
in Appendix C, and expedient lights.
(Prudent people will have made these
extremely useful items well ahead of
time.)
(2) Makeand hangexpedientbedsheet-hammocks.
(3) Install screens or mosquito netting over the
two openings, if mosquitoes or flies are a
problem. Remember, however, that screen or
netting reduces the air flow through a shelter
- even when the air ispumped through with a
KAP.
(4) Dig a stand-up hole near the far end of the
shelter. Make the holeabout 15in. indiameter
and deep enough to permit the tallest of the
shelter occupants to stand erect occasionally.cur LOwE,R ENO.s
