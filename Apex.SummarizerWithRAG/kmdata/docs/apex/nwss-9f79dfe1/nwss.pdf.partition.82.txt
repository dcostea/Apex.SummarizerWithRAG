per 100g dry weight. Most corn in the United States is yellow corn.
"If a diet contains animal protein such as meat. eggs or milk. the recommended protein would be less than 55g per day. Ifall
the protein is from milk or eggs. only 41g per day is required.
The niacin in corn is not fully available unless corn is treated with an alkali, such as the lime or ashes added by Mexicans
and Americans in the South and Southwest to the water in which they soak or boil corn kernels.
Â·'.Infants. children. and pregnant and lactating women should receive IOllg(10 micrograms. or400 IV) ofvitamin D. For
others. the current recommended daily allowance (RDA) for vitamin D is 200 IV (5I-'g).
in 1988 I boughtone kilogramfor$18.75, postage
paid. An ample daily dose is 25 milligrams,
about 0.0009 ounce. Ten grams (about one third
ounce) isenoughfor a wholeyearfor oneperson
who is eating only unsprouted grain and/or
other foods providing no vitamin C. One gram
(1,000 mg) of crystalline ascorbic acid is 1/4
teaspoonful. If you do not have a 1/4 teaspoon,
put one level teaspoonful of the crystals on a
piece of paper, and divide the little pile into 4
equal parts: each will be approximately 1,000
mg. One of these 1,000 mg piles can easily be
divided into 4 tiny piles, each 250 mg. A 250 mg
pile provides 10 ample daily doses of 25 mg
each. If your family has ~ 1,000,000 mg supply,
taking a 50 mg daily dose of pure crystalline
ascorbic acid may be preferred, eithersprinkled
on food or dissolved in water.
One good expedient way to prevent or cure scurvy
is to eat sprouted seeds - not just the sprouts.
Sprouted beans prevented scurvy during a famine in
India. Captain James Cook wasable to keep hissailors
from developing scurvy during a three-year voyage by
having them drink an unfermented beer made from
dried, sprouted barley.
