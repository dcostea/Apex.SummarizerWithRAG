 are making a KAP to fit into a
rectangular opening, make. its frame 4 in.
SHORTER than the height of its opening and 1 in.
NARROWER than the width of the opening.
c. For this 3-ft model, tie the pull-cord to the
center brace about lil2 in. below the hinge line, as
shown in Fig. 12. (If you tie it lower, your arm
movements will waste energy.) Use small nails or
wire to keep the tie end from slipping up or down
on the center brace. (For a more durable
connection, see Fig. 22.)
Cut a slot in the flap above the connection of
the pull-cord to the vertical brace, deep enough so
that this flap will close completely when the KAP is
being pulled. Tape the end and edges of the slot.ORNL-DWG 66-12333A
Fig. 13. Flaps attached 1/4 inch in front of
chicken wire used for flap-stops.
Note in Fig. 13 that each pivot-wire is held firm
and straight by 2 staples securing each end. The
wire used should be at least as springy as coat
hanger wire. If string is used instead of wire, nylon
cord about the diameter of coat hanger wire is best
for the pivot-strings.
If the KAP is wider than 3 ft, its center vertical
brace should also be covered with a 1/4-in.-thick
board, and each pivot-wire should be attached to it.
Furthermore, the center of each flap should be
notched.
v. INSTALLATION AND ACCESSORIES
A. Minimum Open Spaces Around a KAP
To pump its maximum volume, an air-supply
KAP with good metal hinges should be installed in
its opening so that it swings only about 1/2 in. above
the bottom of the opening and only 1/2 in. to 1 in.
from the sides of the opening.
B. Adequately Large Air Passageways
When using a KAP as an air-supply pump to
force air through a shelter, it is essential to provide
a low-resistance air passageway all the way through
the shelter structure from an outdoor air-intake
opening for outdoor air to a separate air-exhaust
opening to the outdoors (see Fig. 14).

Fig. 14.A low-resistance air passageway is one that is
no smaller in cross-sectional area than half the size
of the KAP pumping the air. For example, a
36 X 29-in. KAP should have a passageway no
smaller than about 3112 sq. ft. An air-supply KAP of
this size will force at least 1000 cubic feet per
minute (1000 cfm) through a shelter having such
openings, if it is installed"as illustrated in Fig. 14.
If smaller air passageways or air-exhaust
openings are provided, the volume of air pumped
will be greatly reduced. For example, if the
air-exhaust opening is only 13/4 sq. ft e/4 the size of
this KAP), then this KAP will pump only about
500 cfm. A!1d if the air-exhaust opening is only a
6 X 6-in. exhaust duct e/4 sq. ft), then this same
36 X 29-in. KAP will pump only about 50 cubic
feet per minute.
