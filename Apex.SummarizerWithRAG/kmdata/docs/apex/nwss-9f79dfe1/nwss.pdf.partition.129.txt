 its occu-
pants from receiving fatal or incapacitating
radiation doses, and also from receiving doses
large enough to seriously worsen their risks of
developing cancer in the years following an
attack. Shelters with a protection factor of 40
(PF40) meettheminimumstandardofprotection
for public.sheltersthroughoutthe United States,
andpermanentfamilyfallout sheltersdescribed
in official pamphlets provide at least PF 40
protection. In almost all fallout areas, PF-40
shelters would prevent occupants from receiv-
ingfatal orincapacitatingradiationdoses while'
inside these shelters. However, in areas of
heavy fallout the occupants of PF-40 shelters
could receive radiation doses large enough to
significantlycontributetotheriskofcontracting
cancer years later. Furthermore, the larger the
dose you receive while in a shelter, the smaller
the dose you can receive after you leave shelter
without being incapacitated or killed by your
total dose.
Ifyou builda permanentshelter, you would
be foolish to build a shelter with a PF of only 40
when additional protection is so easy to obtain.
Bymakinga shelterwitha 6-inch-thickconcrete

withothereasilyattaineddesignfeatures shown
in Figs. 17.1 and 17.2, youcanhave a shelterwith
a protection factor of about 1000. (An occupant

I/S" STEELshelter, its occupants mustplace containers full
of water andfor other good shielding material
against the door. They can do this easily and
quickly if the shelter is supplied with filled
watercontainers such as describedinthe Water
section of this chapter.
The illustrated shelter room has 106 square
feet of floor space - room, enough for 5 adults
and the survival essentials they will need for
longoccupancy, ifshelterfurnishings likethose
described inthischapterare provided. Foreach
additional occupant, increase this shelter's
lengthby2feet. To increase room size, increase
length and not width. This retains maximum
roof strength at minimum cost.
Note in Figs. 17.1 and 17.2 the 12-inch-thick
concrete wall between the landing at the foot of
the stairs and the end ofthe shelterroom.
