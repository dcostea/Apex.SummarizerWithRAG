ETS
A diet consisting solely of wheat, corn, or rice,
and salt has most of the essential nutrients. The
critical deficiencies would be vitamins A, C, and D.
Such a grain-based diet can serve adults and older
children as their "staff of life" for months. Table 9.1
shows how less than 13(4 pounds of whole wheat
or dry yellow corn satisfies most of the essential
nutritional requirements of a long-term emergency
ration. [The nutritional values that are deficient are
printed in bold type, to make an easier comparison
with the Emergency Recommendations, also printed
in bold type. Food energy is given in kilocalories
(kcal), commonly called calories (Cal).] Expedient
ways of supplying the nutrients missing from these
rations are described in a following section of this
chapter.
Other common whole grains would serve about
as well as wheat and yellow corn. At least 1(6 oz of salt
per day (about 5 grams) is essential for any ration
that is to be eaten for more than a few days, but 't, oz
(about 10 g or 3(4 tablespoon) should be available
to allow for increased salt needs and to make grain
and beans more palatable. This additional salt would
be consumed as needed.
To repeat: few Americans at first would be able
to eat the 3 or 4 quarts of thick mush that would be
necessary with a ration consisting solely of whole-
kernel wheat or corn. Only healthy Americans
determined to survive would be likely to fare well
for months on such unaccustomed and monotonous
food as an all-graindiet. Eatingtwo or more different
kinds of grain and cooking in different ways would
make an all-grain diet both more acceptable and
more nourishing.
Not many people would be able to eat 27 oz
(dry weight before cooking) of beans in a day, and
fewer yet could eat a daily ration of almost 23 oz
of soybeans. Beans as single-food diets are not
recommended because their large protein content
requires the drinking of more fluids. Roasted peanuts
would provide a better single-food ration.
GRAIN SUPPLEMENTED WITH BEANS
People who live on essentially vegetarian diets
eat a little of their higher-quality protein food at every
meal, along with the grain that is their main source
of nutrition. Thus Mexicans eat some beans along
with their corn tortillas, and Chinese eat a little
fermented soybean food or a bit of meat or fish with
a bowl of rice. Nutritionists have found that grainsTable 9.1. Daily rations of 100% grain, beans, or peanuts"
