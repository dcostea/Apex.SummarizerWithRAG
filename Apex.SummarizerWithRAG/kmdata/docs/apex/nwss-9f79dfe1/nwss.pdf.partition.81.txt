"Salt (I 1 oz. or 10 g, or', tablespoon) should be available. This would be consumed as needed.
"White corn supplies no Vitamin A, whereas yellow corn supplies 49 RE (retinol equivalent, a measure of Vitamin A value)

If most of the protein is from milk or eggs. only 41 g per day is recommended.
"The niacin in corn is not fully available unless the corn is treated with an alkali. such as the lime or ashes Mexicans (and
many Americans) add to the water in which corn kernels are soaked or boiled.

are low in some of the essential amino acids that the
human body needs to build its proteins. For long-term
good health, the essential aminoacids must besupplied
in the right proportions with each mealby eating some
foods with more complete proteins than grains have.
Therefore, in a prolonged food crisis one should strive
to eat atevery mealat least a little of any higher-quality
protein foods that are available. These include ordinary
beans, soybeans, milk powder, meat, and eggs.
Table 9.2 shows that by adding 7.0 oz (200 g) of
red beans (or other common dried beans) to 21.1 oz
(600 g) of either whole wheat or yellow corn, with salt
added, you can produce rations that contain adequate
amounts of all the important nutrients except vitamin
C, vitamin A, vitamin D, and fat. If 5.3 oz (150 g) of
soybeans are substituted for the red beans, the fat
requirement is satisfied. The 600 g of yellow corn
contains enough carotene to enable the body to
produce morethan halfthe emergency recommendation
ofvitamin A.The small deficiencies inriboflavin would
not cause sickness.
Otherabundant grains, such asgrain sorghums or
barley, may beused instead of the wheat or cornshown
in Table 9.2 to produce fairly well-balanced rations.
Other legumes would serve to supplement grain about
as well as red beans. (Peanuts are the exception: al-
though higherinenergy(fat)thanany otherunprocessed
food, the qualityoftheir protein isnot as high asthat of
other legumes.)

â€¢ Vitamin C
A deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) causes
scurvy. This deadly scourge would be the first nutri-
tional disease to afflict people having only grain and/or
beans and lacking the know-how needed to sprout
them and produce enough vitamin C. Within only 4to
6weeks of eatinga ration containingno vitamin C, the
first symptom of scurvy would appear: swollen and
bleeding gums. This would be followed by weakness,
then large bruises, hemorrhages, and wounds that
would not heal. Finally, death from hemorrhages and
heart failure would result.
The simplest and least expensive way to
make sure that you, your family and neighbors
do not sufferordie post-attackfrom scurvyis to

vitamin C, which is the crystalline "ascorbic
acid" form. Unlike vitamin C tablets, pure vita-
