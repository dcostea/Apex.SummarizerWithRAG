am how to measure radiation dose rates (roentgens
per hour =R/hr), how to calculate doses [R] received in different time
intervals, and how to determine time Interval. (hours and/or minutes) in
which specified doses would be received. Then this section lists the sizes
ofdoses (numberofR) that the average person can tolerate without being
sickened, that he is likely to survive, and that he is likely to be killed by.

Ifan exposure results inthe readingafter the exposure being lessthan5
mm, recharge the KFM and expose itagainfor one ofthe shortertime
intervals listed.
4. Expose the KFM to fallout radiation for one of the time intervals
shown inthe vertical columns of the table attached to the KFM. (Study
the following table.) Ifthe dose rate isnot known even approximately.
first expose the fully charged KFM for one minute. For dependable
measurements outdoors. expose the charged KFM about 3feet above
the ground. The longer outdoor exposures usually are best made by
attaching the KFM with 2strong rubber bands to a stick or pole. being
careful never to tilt the KFM too much.
5. Read the KFM after the exposure. while the KFM rests on an
approximately horizontal surface.
6. Find the time interval that givesa dependable reading - by exposing
the fullycharged KFM for one or more ofthe listed time intervals until
the reading after the exposure is;
(ajNot lessthan 5 mm.
(b) At least 2 mm lessthan the reading before the exposure.
7. Calculate by simple subtraction the difference in the apparent
separation of the lower edges of the leaves before the exposure and
after the exposure. Anexample: Ifthe reading before the exposure is18
mm and the reading after the exposure is 6 mm, the difference in
readings is 18mm - 6 mm = 12mm.
8. If an exposure results in a difference in readings of less than 2 mm,
recharge the KFM and expose it again for one of the longer time
intervals listed. (If there appears to be no difference in the readings
taken before and afteran exposurefor one minute. this does not prove
there is absolutely no fallout danger. Take a longer reading.)
10. Use the table attached to the
KFM to find the dose rate
(RI hr) during the time of ex-
posure. The dose rate (Rjhr) is
found at the intersection of the
vertical column of numbers
under the time interval used
and of the horizontal line of
numbers that lists the calcu-
lated difference in readings at
its left end.
An example: Ifthe time interval of the exposure was 1 MIN. and the
difference inthe readings was 12mm, the table shows that the dose rate
during the time interval of the exposure was 9.2 R/HR (9.2 roentgens
per hour).
