*Beans, like wheat, in many communities
can be purchased from local farmers' co-ops or
local stores at much lower delivered cost than
from mail order firms. In one small Colorado
town the co-op sold 25 pounds of pintobeans in a
polyethylene bag for $11.25-45 cents a pound.
Local supermarkets sell bulk pinto beans for
around 60 cents a pound.

storage is the instant non-fat milk powder sold
byPreparedness Products. This Mormon-owned
firm's 1990 FOB price is $57.95 for a case of 6
nitrogen-packed cans, containing a total of 22.5
pounds. The author bought a case three years
ago and found this non-fat instant milk powder
to be excellent. At $2.58 a pound, plus UPS
shipping charges, the cost is considerably less
than for comparable milk powder packaged for
multi-yearstorage andsoldbyothercompanies.

â€¢ CAUTIONS: Typical health food stores and
mostfirms that specializein survivalfoods sell
basic foods at high prices, especially grains,
beans, and milk powder. Investigate several
other sources before buying.
To make sure that an advertised "one year
supply" of survival foods actually will keep an
adult well nourished for a whole year, require
the seller to inform you by mail what his "one
year supply" provides a typical adult male in:
(1) calories, k cal; (2) protein, g; and (3) fat, g.
Then you can use the values in the "Emergency
Recommendations" columninTable9.
