Have two or more occupants sitting
inside the shelter each use a fan of the
size described above to fan the air so
as to increase its velocity inthe direction
in which air already is flowing through
the shelter. Such Directional Fanning
is especially effective in increasing the
air flow through small, narrow shelters.
ill, ill After a slight pause,
leisurely withdraw the almost horizontal
fan until the bottom of its blade almost
touches your stomach -- preparatory
to the next power stroke.
To increase the flow of air

the occupants:
With one or more DirectionalFans, air inside a shelter can be distribute
effectively and the occupants cooled. Also, if during the time of maximui
fallout dose rate the occupants get close together in the most protective pa
of the shelter, they often will get unbearably hot unless fanned.
To fan air out through an air-exhaust opening, sit facing the opening wit
your elbows about 4 inches lowerthan the bottomoftheopening. Then com

OJ Quickly raise the fan to a
vertical position close in front of your
face and immediately fan (push) a
slug of air into the opening - ending
the power stroke with your arms fully
extended and with the fan almost
horizontal and out of the way of air
that was "sucked" behind the fan and
is still flowing outthrough the opening.
To avoid higher radiation exposures
near openings, build an essentially
airtight partition across the shelter
room, with a 24-inch-high x 20-inch-
wide hole in it through whichto fan. By
fanning through a 24 x 20-inch hole in
a cardboard partition built across a doorway inside aU-shaped perrnanei
trench shelter 76 feet long, the air flow was increased by an average of :32
cubic feet per minute.
To ventilate larger basements, big
covered trenches, and otherlarge shel-
ters lacking adequate ventilation, use
one or more large loman fans. See
sketch. Note that the 20 x 30-inch fan
blade is made like a 2-stick kite, and
that the upper end of the longer dia-
gonal stick serves as a 10-inch handle.
The model illustrated is made of 2
nominal 1 x 2-inch boards, one 46
inches long and the other 35 inches
long. These boards are connected at a
point 17y, inches from their lower
ends, first with a single clinched nail,
and then by being tied securely. The
edges ofthe handle are rounded smooth.
The blade frame is covered on
both sides with strong bedsheet cloth,
that is wrapped around and secured to
the strong cordsor wires tiedtonotches
cut in the boards (or sticks) near the 4
corners of the blade. (If cord or wire is
not available, 4 2-inch-wide strips of
strong cloth, slightly twisted, serve
well.)

A 2-Handled Directional Fan of
the size illustrated is less tiring to use
and requires less manual dexterity
than does a I-handled fan with the
same size blade. With this small 2-
handled fan you quite easily can force
about 300 cubic feet per minute (300
efm)of outdoorair through a crowded
trench or basement shelter. This is
enough air for up to 9 adults crowded
into a small shelter in extremely hot.
humid weather, and enough for about
100 people in cold weather.
