less than 11/16-in. thick, make the height of each of your sides
16-3/4-in. less the difference between 3/4-in. and the actual
thickness of your plywood. See Fig. 7.)
Bottom, 17-1/2 x 32-in.
Top, 13-1/2 x 32-in.
Two valve frames, each 4 x 12-in.
Piston, 12x 12-in.(of 3/8-in. plywood).
Two construction forms, each 12x 12-in.(of3/8-in. plywood).
5. Make the following plywood rectangles with tolerances of +or-
1/16 in.:
Back end, 13-1/2 x 17-1/4-in. (See Fig. 8.)
Removable (upper) part of front end, 13-1/2 x 10-7/8 in. (See Figs. 7
and 9.)
Fixed (lower) part of front end, 13-1/2x 6-3/8-in. (See Figs. 7and 10.)
The four partsof the air-intake duct: two each 6-1/2 x 6-in.; two each
6-112x 7-1/2-in. '
Two spacers (to be nailed to the bottom) each 3/4 x 3/4 x 32-in.
6. Saw out the 10 valve holes; a tolerance of +or - 1/8 in. is good
enough. (See Figs. 7,8,9, and 10.)
7. Saw a square 6 x 6-in. hole in the center of the top, as shown in
Fig. 2 - ifyou are going to install the homemade filter (described in
separate instructions) directly on top ofyour pump. (To connectyour
pumptoa round air-intake pipe, cutan appropriate round hole in the
top.)
8. Sandpaper the finished sides of the PARTITION, the two sides,
and the bottom, to reducefrictionon the reciprocatingpiston. Use fine
sandpaper.
9. Make and attach the 6 valve flaps, to complete the flap valves,
that are the lowest resistance, quickest acting type tested.
a. Make a 3-3/4 x 5-3/4-in. cardboard TEMPLATE, usingcarbon
paper to transfer lines of Fig. 11tocardboard. (See Fig. 11on page 7,PUTTING THE PUMP "BOX" TOGETHER
1. The following procedure is the best tested construction method
for persons who lack experience in putting parts together so that all
corners are exactly square. or who do not have the big clamps and
other glueing equipment used by cabinet makers. This procedure is
best carried out by two persons working together.
2. On the finished side of the top. draw two parallel lines exactly 12
in. apart and parallel to the top's 32-in.-longedges. Each of these lines
will be 3/4-in. from an edge. Alsodraw a line 6 in. from and parallel to
each end of the top. to mark the positions of the two valve frames. See
Fig. 2.
3. Build the pump's "box" upside down; start by placing its top on
the floor. as indicated by Fig. 12.
Fig. 12. Parts of the Pump "Box". with Dimensions in Inches. The Roman numbers give the best tested order for
attaching these parts to each other.
4. Attach the two valve frames II and III to the top I with
'construction adhesive. positioning each of them 6 in. from an end of
the top 1.Make sure that each frame's flap valve is upside down and
facing away from the center of the pump. Remove any adhesive
that is on the top beyond the ends of the valve frames. .
(When usingconstruction adhesiveto makethis pump, it isbestto
apply a rather thin coat to only one of the two plywood surfaces to be
joined. Then promptly rub one plywood part slightly back and forth
against the other. while pressing them together-thus making sure
that both surfaces are coated and in close' contact. Wait until the
adhesive sets and bonds adequately before attaching more parts.)
5. Draw two parallellineson the unfinished sideofthe PARTITION,
each ;] inches from one of its ends. Adhere the two 12-in.-long
unattached edgesof the valve frames to the PARTITION on these two
lines.
