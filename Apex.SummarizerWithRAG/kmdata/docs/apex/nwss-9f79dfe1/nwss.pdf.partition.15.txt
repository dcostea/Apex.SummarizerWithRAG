: Fallout radiation penetrates everything;
there is no escaping its deadly effects.
• Facts: Some gamma radiation from fallout will
penetrate the shielding materials of even an excellent
shelter and reach its occupants. However, the
radiation dose' that the occupants of an excellent
shelter would receive while inside this shelter can be
reduced to a dose smaller than the average American
receives during his lifetime from X rays and other
radiation exposures normal in America today. The
design features of such a shelter include the use of a
sufficient thickness of earth or other heavy shielding
material. Gamma rays are like X rays, but more
penetrating. Figure 1.3 shows how rapidly gamma
rays are reduced in number (but not intheirability to
penetrate) by layers of packed earth. Each of the
layers shown is one halving-thickness of packed
earth-about 3.6 inches (9 centimeters).' A halving-
thickness is the thickness of a material which reduces
by half the dose of radiation that passes through it.
The actual paths ofgamma rays passingthrough
shielding materials are much more complicated, due
to scattering, etc., than are the straight-line paths
shown in Fig. 1.3. But when averaged out, the
effectiveness of a halving-thickness of any material is
approximately as shown. The densera substance, the
better it serves for shielding material. Thus, a
halving-thickness of concrete is only about 2.4 inches

Fig. 1.3. Illustration of shieldingagainst fallout radiation. Note the increasingly large improvements inthe
attenuation (reduction) factors that are attained as each additional halving-thickness of packed earth isadded.
If additional halving-thicknesses of packed
earth shielding are successively added to the five
thicknesses shown in Fig. 1.3, the protection factor
(PF) issuccessively increased from 32to 64, to 128,to
256, to 512, to 1024, and so on.
• Myth: A heavy nuclear attack would set
practically everything on fire, causing"firestorms"in
cities that would exhaust the oxygen in the air. All
shelter occupants would be killed by the intense heat.
• Facts: On a clear day, thermal pulses (heat
radiation that travelsat the speed oflight)from an air
burst can set fire to easily ignitable materials (such as
window curtains, upholstery, dry newspaper, and dry
grass) over about as large an area as is damaged by
the blast. It can cause second-degree skin burns to
exposed people who are as far as ten miles from
a one-megaton (I MT) explosion. (See Fig. 1.4.)
(A I-MT nuclear explosion is one that produces the
same amount of energy as does one million tons of
TNT.) Ifthe weather is very clear and dry, the area of
fire danger could be considerably larger.
