 expensive
dose rate meters, are that it reads in centigrays
per hour (cGy/hr is equivalent to Rads/hr, or
R/hr)anddoes notmeasuredose rateslowerthan
0.1 cGy/hr (100 mR/hr). In 1987 this portable,
four-digit-liquid-display dose rate meteris sold
by Plessey Controls for 250 Brrtish pounds plus
air shipment charges - all pre-paid. To learn

However, in a nuclear war 100 mR/hr will be a
low dose rate in most life-threatening fallout
areas. (I boughta PDRM82 directfrom England
in 1984, my objective being to have it tested at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I later learned
that such testing was unnecessary, since U.S.
Army specialists already had tested the PDRM
82 and had found it excellent.)
Technical Note. Conversion of readings of
mostforeign andscientificradiation-monitoring
instrumentsto the radiationunits usually given
by American civil defense instruments, or used
inthe U.S. inregulationsandarticlesconcerning
radiation hazards:
ABSORBED RADIATION DOSE
1 gray (1 Gy) =100 Rads
1 centigray (1 cGy) = 1 Rad
(As explained in the first section ofthis
chapter,for practicalcivildefense work
1 Rad = 1 roentgen = 1 Rem.)
DOSE EQUIVALENT
1 sievert (1 Sv) =100 Rems
1 millisievert (1 mSv) =0.1 Rem
ACTIVITY
1 bequerel (1 Bq) =27 picocuries
(Radiation contamination of milk and
water are given in picocuries per liter,
or bequerels per liter. One picocurie is
one millionth of one millionth of a
curie: 1curieis37,000,000,000bequerels.)
No wonder that most newspaper and tele-
vision accounts of radiation accidents and
hazards are confused!
I have not been able to find an American-
made, modern dose rate meter that is designed
for wartime use and is being sold in 1987.
Among those designed for peacetime use that
may be satisfactory in wartime is the RO-2A
manufactured by Eberline, P.O. Box2108, Santa
Fe, New Mexico 87504-2108. The RO-2A is a
portable air ionization-chamber instrument
used to measure beta, gamma, and X-ray radia-
tion from 50 mR/hrto50 R/hr. The price in 1987
is$950.00. InEberline's summary specifications
and in the specifications that I have read of
otherU.S. manufacturersofdose rate meters, no
mention is made of the instruments' being
EMP-proof.
Dosimeters
Several reliable dosimeters and dosimeter-
chargers are sold in the United States. Among
the establishedretailsources is DosimeterCor-
poration,P.O. Box42377, Cincinnati, Ohio45242.
Its DCA Model No. 686 measures accumulated
dosesfrom 0to600 R, andinJanuaryof1986 sold
for $59.95. The battery powered charger, DCA
Model No. 909, cost $90.00; one charger can be
used to charge several dosimeters.A more expensive direct reading 600 R
dosimeter is model 019-006 of Atomic Products
Corporation, P.O. Box 1157, Center Moriches,
New York 11934. It sells for $120.00; dosimeter
charger 020-001, " ... used to 'zero' all Direct-
Reading Dosimeters", costs $98.00.
Tokeepthemdependable, allcommercially
available dosimeters and dose rate meters
should be (1) kept supplied with fresh batteries
for charging or operating, (2) checked with a
strong enough radiation source (at no longer
than 3-year intervals) to see if they still are
measuringradiationaccurately,and(3)repaired
if necessary. (To learn whether a dose rate
meter still is functioning, use a radioactive
check source such as Dosimeter Corporation's
Check Source (Model 3001), that eontains 5
microcuries cesium-137 and sells for $35.00.
