 pressed into the papercovering the stick.
Next, smooth the cut edge, and cover it with small pieces of freezer tape or
otherflexible tape.
3. Cut out the PAPER PATTERN TO WRAP AROUND KFM CAN. (Cut
one pattern out of Pattern Page A.) GIue (ortape) this pattern to the can,
starting with one of the two short sides of the pattern. Secure this starting
short side directly over the side seam of the can. Wrap the pattern snugly
around the can, gluing or taping it securely as it is being wrapped. (If the
pattern istoo wide to fit flat between the rims of the can, trim a little off its
lower edge.)
4. Sharpen a small nail, by filing,or rubbing on concrete, for use as a punch
to make the four holes needed to install the stop-threads in the ionization
chamber (the can). (The stop-threads are insulators that stop the
charged aluminum leaves from touching the can and being discharged.)

The stop-threads can be
installed by using a needle
to thread a single thread
through all four holes. Use
a very clean thread, prefer-
ably nylon, and do not touch
the parts of this thread that
will be inside the can and
will serve as the insulating
stop-threads. Soiled threads
are poor insulators.
(See illustrations.)
Have one person hold the
can over a horizontal stick or
a round wooden tool-handle,
that ideally has a diameter
about' as large as the dia-
meter of the can. Then a
second person can use the
sharpened nail and a ham-
mer to punch four very small
holes through the sides of
the can at the points shown
by the four crosses on the
pattern. Make these holes
just large enough to run a
needle through them, and
then move the needle in the
holes so as to bend back the
obstructing points of metal.

As soon as the aluminum foil is cool enough to touch, fold and crumple
the edges of each aluminum foil "bowl" together, to make a rough
aluminum-covered "ball" of each batch of anhydrite.
Promptly seal the batches in airtight jars or other airtight containers, and
keep containers closed except when taking out an aluminum-covered
"ball."
