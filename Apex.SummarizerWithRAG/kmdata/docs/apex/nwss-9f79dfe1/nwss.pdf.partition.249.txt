Fig. 0.14. Expedient blast door that can be closed and secured in 4 seconds. Four
seconds would be too little time if the shelter is at the 15-psi overpressure range
from a 550-kiloton or smaller warhead - typical of the 1987 Soviet ICBM
arsenal. (See the last paragraph on page 255.) However, this door closure is still
the best blast-tested expedient means to secure a closed blast door.Fig. D.15. Tire-strip hinges nailed to an ex-
pedient, 4-inch-thick blast door made of plywood,
designed to withstand 50-psiblasteffects ofvery large
weapons and undamaged by blast at the 53-psi
range.
Fig. D.16. Blast-tested triangular blast door
made of hand-hewn pine poles, notched and nailed
together. This door closed on a triangular pole base
that is concealed in this photo by two of the three
blast-protector logs that also withstood 53-psi blast
effects.
Fig. D.17. Hewing flat sides on a pole with a
sharp ax.
To hew a second flat side at right angles to the
first side, rotate the pole 90°, secure it again, and
repeat-as pictured in Fig. D.17.
• Provide blast closures for an adequate ventila-
tion system. The following two expedient closure
systems permit adequatevolumes ofventilatingair to
be pumped through a shelter:
1. Install two blastdoors, one on eachend ofthe
shelter, designed to be left open until the extremely
bright light from a large blast is seen. Figure D.14
shows a door held open by a prop-stick that can be
yanked away by the attached pull-cord. While
propped open, one blast door serves as an extremely
low-resistance air-intake opening, and the other
serves as an air-exhaust opening. A large KAP can
pump air at the rate ofseveral thousand cubicfeet per
minute through such open doors.
When an attack is expected, each pull-cord
should be held by a shelter occupant who stays ready
at all times to yank out the prop-stick as soon as he
sees the light of an explosion. After the door has
fallen closed, the loop at the end of its wire bridle is
close to the upper hook ofthe load-binder and at the
same height (Fig. D.14). The person who doses the
doorshould quicklyhook the upper hook ofthe load-
binder into the wire loopand pull down on the handle
ofthe load-binder. The door will then be-tightlyshut.
(Sources during an emergency would be the millions
of load-binders owned by truckers and farmers.)
At distances from a large explosion where blast
wave and overpressure effects are not destructive
enough to smash most good expedient blast shelters,
there is enough time between the instant the light of
the explosion is seen and the arrival ofits blast wave
for an alert person to shut and securely fasten a well-
designed blast door. The smaller the explosion and
the greater the overpressure range, the shorter the
warning time. Thus at the IS-psi overpressure range
from a I-megaton surface burst (1.5 miles), the blast
wave arrives about 2.
