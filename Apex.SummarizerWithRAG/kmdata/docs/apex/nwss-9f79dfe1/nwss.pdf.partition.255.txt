3. Can be built at low cost in home workshops by many Americans,
using only materials available in most towns.
4. Could be made by the millions in thousands of shops allover the
V.S..for mass production during a recognized prolonged crisis, using
only plywood and other widely available materials.
To produce such a shelter ventilating pump, during the past 20
years I have worked intermittently designing and building several
types of homemade air pumps. However, until I was traveling in
China as an official guest in October 1982and saw a wooden double-
action piston pump being used, I did not conceive or come across a
design that I was able to develop into a shelter-ventilating pump that
meets all of the requirements outlined above. Now I have made and
tested a simple homemade Plywood Double-Action Piston Pump,
described below, that satisfies these requirements. Three other
persons have used successively improved versionsofthese instructions
tomake this model.and several others have contributed improvements.
HOW A PLYWOOD DOUBLE-ACTION PISTON PUMP
WORKS
Fig. 1picturesthe box-liketest model described inthese instructions.
Fig. I. Plywood Double-Action Piston Pump, with manometer
attached for tests.
Fig, 2 illustrates a vertical section through a slightly improved
model, and shows the 12x12-in. plywood piston being pushed from
right to left, causing air from the outdoors to be "sucked" down.the
open air-supply duct in the top of the pump, then down to the right
through the open valve in the airtight frame (that is above and near
the right end of the PARTITION), and on down into the lower-
pressure area behind the leftward-moving piston,
Because the air to the right of the leftward-moving piston is at a
lower pressure than the air in the shelter room, the exhaust valves in
the front end (the handle endtof the pump are held closed,
Duringthis halfofthe pumpingcycle, the higher-pressureair inthe
partofthe pump'ssquare"cylinder"tothe leftoftheleftward-moving
piston opens the air-exhaust valves in the back end of the pump, and
fresh air isforced out into the shelterroom. The higher-pressureairto
the left of the valve in the airtight frame (that is above the left end of
the PARTITION) keeps this valve closed, while the lower-pressure
air to the right of this valve helps keep it closed.
When the piston is pulled tothe right, all ofthe valvesshownclosed
are quicklyopened, and all shown open are quicklyclosed. Then fresh
air is forced into the shelter room through the opened exhaust valves
in the front end of the pump.
