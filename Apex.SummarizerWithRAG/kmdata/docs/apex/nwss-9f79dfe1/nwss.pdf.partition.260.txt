. The two plastic
flaps of its exhaust valves each
cover two 2 x 4-in. valve holes,
that are positioned the same as
the four valve holes in the front
end.

Fig. 7. Front End (Operator's End) of Plywood Double-Action Piston Pump, The two 4 x 12-in.valve
frames are shown by dashed lines, as is the 12 x 26-in. PARTITION.Fig. 10. Fixed Part of Front End, Unfinished. Only the plywood
is shown.
and note that this TEMPLATE outlines the right halfof the 3-3/4 x
11-1/2-in. plastic-film flap.) Also transfer the dashed tack-line and
mark the ends of the 4 horizontal stop-string lines. Drill 8small holes
through the cardboard at the ends ofthe 4stop-stringlines, sothatyou
can use a pencil to mark these points on plywood. .
b. Useyour TEMPLATE to mark around the 2x4-in. valve holes
in plywood parts: (1) the positions of the ends of each hole's 8 stop-
strings, (2)the rightside-edge and the bottom-edge ofeach flap after
it is attached, and (3) the tack-lines.
c. Drill a 1/16-in. diameter hole through the plywood at each
point marked for an end of a stop-string.
d. With nylon kite string (or other nylon string about 1/16-in. in
diameter, such as 50-lb-test nylon fishing line) and a big enough
needle, string the "four" stop-strings across each 2 x 4-in. hole,(Use a
string long enough to make "four" uncut stop-strings.) Start on the
unfinished, back side of the plywood, on the opposite side from the
future valve flap. Tosecurethe startingend, wrap the stringaround a
half-driven tack, and then drive it in. Keep pullingthe stringtightas
you thread it through the' holes and as you wrap its finishing end
around a half-driven tack. Finally epoxy the string in all ofthe holes,
onthe back side ofthe plywood. (An equallystrongnylonstringcan be
made by twisting together 4 pieces of waxed nylon dental floss.)
(Stop-strings also can be positioned by using No.3 upholstery
tacks in place of the 1/16-in. diameter holes. Drive a tack partly in,
wind the stringaround it while pullingthe stringtight, and drive the
tack completely in, to hold the string securely. Finally, coat the tack
headsand the adjacent plywood with asmooth coveringofadhesive, to
provide a smooth seat for the valve flap.)
e. Cut out 6 plastic flaps of transparent 4-mil plastic film (each
3-3/4 x 11-1/2 in.). The easiest way to accurately cut a flap of thin
plastic film istomakea cardboard template3-3/4 x 11-1/2-in..place it
on the film, and cut around it with a very sharp knife.
f. In preparation for attaching a flap over each pair of 2 x 4-in.
valve holes, cover the plywood aboveeach pairofholes with masking
tape, up tothe straight"tack line" thatyou already have drawn 1/2in.
above each hole. Use your cardboard TEMPLATE. The masking
tape will prevent the adhesive (that will be used to attach each valve
'flap) from being applied too near the 2 x 4-in. holes, where adhesive
would keep a flap from opening fully.
g. Position each ofthe 6flaps properly in its closed position, with
its lower edge onthe line thatyou already have used the TEMPLATE
to draw 3/4 in. below each flap's pair of 2 x 4-in. holes.
