 the shelter opening through which air is leaving
the shelter, to avoid buildup of slight amounts of
carbon monoxide and other headache-causinggases.
If the shelter is completely closed fora time for any
reason, such as to keep out smoke from a burning
house nearby, all candlesand otherfires inthe shelter
should be extinguished.
Gasoline and kerosene lamps should not be
taken inside a shelter. They produce gases that can
cause headaches or even death. If gasoline or
kerosene lamps are knocked over, as by blast winds
that would rush into sheltersoverextensiveareas, the
results would be disastrous.
SAFE EXPEDIENT LAMPS FOR SHELTERS
The simple expedient lamps described below are
the results of Oak Ridge National Laboratory
experiments which started withoil lamps of the kinds
used by Eskimos and the ancient Greeks. Our
objective was to develop safe, dependable, long-
lasting shelter lights that can be made quickly, using
only common household materials. Numerous field
tests have proved that average Americans can build
good lamps byfollowing the instructions given below
(Fig. 11.2).
These expedient lamps have the following
advantages:
• They are safe. Even ifa burning lamp isknocked
over onto a dry paper, the flame issosmallthat itwill
be extinguished if the lamp fuel being burned is a
cooking oil or fat commonly used in the kitchen, and
if the lamp wick is not much larger than 1/16 inch in
diameter.
• Since the flame isinside ajar, it isnot likely to set
fire to a careless person's clothing or to be blown out
by a breeze.
• With the smallest practical wick and flame, a
lamp burns only about I ounce of edible oil or fat in
eight hours.
• Even with a flame smallerthanthat ofa birthday
candle, there is enough light for reading. To read
easily by such a small flame, attach aluminum foil to
three sides and the bottom of the lamp, and suspend it
between you and your book, just high enough not to
block your vision. (During the long, anxious days
and nights spent waiting for fallout to decay, shelter
occupants willappreciate havingsomeone read aloud
to them.)
• A lamp with aluminum foil attached is an
excellent trap for mosquitoes and other insects that
can cause problems in an unscreened shelter. They
are attracted to the glitteringlight and fall intothe oil.
• Two of these lamps can be made in less than an
hour, once the materials have been assembled, so
there is no reason to wait until a crisis arises to make
them. Oil exposed to the air deteriorates, so it is best
not to store lamps filled with oil or to keep oil-soaked
wicks for months.ORNL OWG 71-7241R
