Fallout radiation guides lor a healthy
person not previously exposed to a
total radiation dose of more than
100 R during a 2-week period:
6 R per dav can betolerated for up to
two months without losing the ability
to work.
100R in a week or less is not likely to
seriously sicken.
350 R in a few days results in a
50-50 chance of dying, under
post-attack conditions.
600 R in a week or less is almost
certain to cause death within a few
weeks.
Reading: With the reading eye 12
inches vertically above the scat. note
on the mm scale the separation of the
lower edges of the leaves. lfthc right
leaf is at 10 mm and the Idt leaf isat
7mrn. the KFM reads 17rnrn. Never
takea reading while a lcatis touching
