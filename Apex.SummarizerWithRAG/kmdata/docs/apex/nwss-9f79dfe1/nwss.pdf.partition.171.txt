Fig. A.3.2. Pictorial Viewof Small-Pole Shelter.Appendix A.4
Aboveground, Door-Covered Shelter
PROTECTION PROVIDED
Against fallout radiation: Protection Factor
about 200 (PF 200) ifcovered with 30 in. of earth. (A
person in the open outside this shelter would receive
about 200times more fallout radiation than ifhe were
inside.) The drawing at the end of Appendix A.4
shows the earth cover only 20 in. thick, resulting in a
PF of about 100.
Against blast: Better protection than most
homes. Blast tests have indicated that this shelter
would be undamaged at least up to the 5-psi
overpressure range from large explosions. Without
blast doors the shelter'soccupants could be injured at
this overpressure range, although probably not
fatally.
Against fire: Fair, if the cloth in the entries is
covered with mud and if the shelter is sufficiently
distant from fires producing carbon monoxide and
toxic smoke.
WHERE PRACTICAL
In a location where at leastone hollow-core
door per occupant is available, where a dry
trench at least 14inchesdeepcan bedug without
difficulty, butthe watertableorrock istooclose
to the surface for a covered-trench shelter to be
practical. (A family evacuating in a pickup
truck or large station wagon can carry enough
doors, with doorknobs removed. Strong boards
at least 6 feet long and at least one full inch
thick, or plywood at least3/4-inch thick, also can
be used to roof this shelter and to support its
overhead earth shielding.
Warning: Somedoors with single-thickness
panels if loaded with earth will break before
they bend enough to result in protective earth
arching.
FOR WHOM PRACTICAL
For a typical family orothergroup withtwo
or more members able to work hard for most of
36 hours. Very littlebuildingskill isneeded.
