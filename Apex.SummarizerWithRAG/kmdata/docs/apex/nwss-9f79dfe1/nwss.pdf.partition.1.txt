 the disaster will be far greater than 
it needs to be. 
Assembling a KFM and learning to use it before you need it will help you lose irrational fear of 
radioactivity. You will not be paralyzed by panic in an emergency. You will know how to conduct 
yourself in a manner that may not only save your life but also the lives of many of those around 
you as well. 
I urge you to study the KFM instructions now and make an instrument. You should realize that 
under terrorist attack conditions the radiation doses you can receive without being incapacitated 
are higher than under nuclear wartime conditions. So you can go to work, drive your truck or car, 
or assist others.

The purpose of this book is to provide
Americans and other unprepared people with
information and self-help instructions that will
significantly increase their chances of sur-
viving a nuclear attack. It brings togetherfield-
tested instructions that, if followed by a large
fraction of Americans during a crisis that pre-
cedes an attack, could save millions of lives.
