4. Fold this 4-ply sheet to make an 8-ply sheet (8 sheets thick) approximately 2
inches by 2 inches, being sure that the two halves of the second-fold edge are
exactly together. This third folding makes an 8-ply aluminum foil sheet with
one comereucdy square.

7. While holding a straight edge
along the THREAD LINE of the
pattern, press with a sharp pencil
so as to make a shallow groove for
the THREAD LINE on the 8-ply
aluminum sheet. Also using a
sharp pencil, trace around the top
and side of the pattern, so as to
indent (groove) the 8-plyfoil.
8. Remove the pattern and cut out the
8-ply aluminum foil leaf. Then, in

Proceed as follows to make each leaf:
1. Cut out a piece of standard aluminum
foilapproximately 4 inches by 8 inches.
2. Fold the aluminum foil to make a 2-ply
(= 2 thicknesses) sheet approximately 4
inches by 4 inches.
3. Fold this 2-ply sheet to make a 4-ply
sheet approximately 2 inches by 4
inches.
Before threading the thread through the four holes, tie a small toggle (see the
preceding sketch) to the long end of the thread. (This toggle can easily be made
of a very small sliver of wood cut about 3/8 in. long.) After the thread has been
pulled through the four holes, attach a second toggle to the thread, about 112inch
from the part of the thread that comes out of the fourth hole. Then the thread can
be pulled tightly down the side of the can and the second small toggle can be
taped securely in place to the side of the can. (If the thread is taped down without
a toggle, it is likely to move under the tape.)
The first toggle and all of the four holes also should be covered with tape, to
prevent air from leaking into the can after it has been covered and is being used
as an ionization chamber.
S. Cut out the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN, found on the following Pattern Page
B. Note that this pattern is NOTa square and that it is smaller than the 8-ply
sheet. Flatten the 8 thicknesses of aluminum foil with the fingers until they
appear to be a single thin, flat sheet.
6. Hold the FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN on top of the 8-ply aluminum foil
sheet, with the pattern's THIRD-FOLDEDGE on top of the third-fold edge of
the 8-ply aluminum sheet. Be sure that one lower comer of the
FINISHED-LEAF PATTERN is on top of the exacdy square comer of the
8-ply aluminum sheet.
